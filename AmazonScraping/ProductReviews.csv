"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Robert Walden","Based on a stupid amount of research and reviews I purchased the Bose SoundLink Mini II and the JBL Charge 3 for review to replace an aging Monster Clarity Bluetooth speaker I had been using for beaches/pools/vacations. Disclaimer: I have never liked Bose anything. I have always thought their product was overrated junk marketed to less than savvy consumers. After reading multiple reviews from sources I trusted, I landed on the MiniLink II and the JBL Charge 3 as best options for my needs. Outside of my mentioned purchases I informally ""reviewed"" several other Bluetooth speakers owned by friends. None of them were worthy of mention here.In summary (and to my surprise): the MiniLink II produced the highest quality audio of any wireless speaker device I have auditioned. It is the unit I kept, and will continue to use. For context, I almost exclusively listen to Spotify on this device, and almost exclusively around the pool. From a music reproduction perspective, nothing I have heard in this price range matches the MiniLink II for wireless sound. It emits truly high-quality audio. However, it is not as loud as the JBL Charge 3. If you are looking for pure volume, the Charge 3 is easily louder. Does this matter? Well, if you are simply looking for something you can hear at a loud pool, the Charge 3 is the better option. It does not have the low-end or fullness of the MiniLink II, nor does it as accurately reproduce audio, but it can attain more audible volumes at large gatherings.I'm not entirely sure these are the best two devices to compare, but if you are looking for great audio, go with the Bose. If  you are looking for loudness, go with the Charge 3.Nobody gave me anything to do this review.",4
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Stuart Goldberg","I bought the original Soundlink Mini about three years ago and have been very happy with it.  I used it at home and at my office.  In my office, I had to keep it at a low volume but it never sounded muffled and delivered clear and crisp highs and sonorous lows.  At home with the volume cranked up, it never failed to deliver.  When the updated version came out, I hesitated but the updates made it worth jumping into the newer version.  My original unit is now gracing my sister's home.The ability to use it as a speakerphone is a handy feature.  Callers have noted that my voice sounds clear.  An incoming call can be answered (or refused) with a tap of a button on top of the unit.For me,  the more noteworthy improvement is in the Bluetooth implementation.  This newer unit has the ability to remember up to eight paired devices and actively (and concurrently) be paired with two of them.  When you turn it on, the unit announces the battery level and to which two devices it is paired.  (The audible prompts can be disabled.)  At that point, it will play content from the first device which is outputting audio content.  If that device stops and the other device starts playing, the speaker will seamlessly switch to that second device.  My device automatically connects to my laptop and smartphone.  It remembers my Kindle Fire and, if the laptop is off, will connect to the Kindle.  Very clever.  Bose has replicated this Bluetooth implementation on their other devices.They have also increased the battery life and changed from a proprietary charging connector to a standard mini-USB port.  All-in-all a worthy update.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Kelly & Joey","Please let me know if my review was helpful to you. This will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help :)Simply put Bose SoundLink Mini II is possibly the best all around portable bluetooth speaker on the market. The speaker has plentiful of features such as ability to work as a speakerphone, charge through USB outlets or on its own cradle, remembering multiple bluetooth devices and pairing to two bluetooth devices at once. Many of the features do not really even matter to me–I'm happy that it pairs to my phone and plays my music with wonderful audio quality.Pairing process was very simple, after selecting language in the beginning the speaker automatically put itself in pairing mode and thus I was able to get music playing in less than 30 seconds from the point of turning it on. There are + and - buttons on the speakers to adjust volume if needed by I personally control volume and music playback through my phone instead. Not that there's something wrong with the buttons, it's just a personal preference.FEATURES:* Big sound--with deep bass--for a full-range listening experience* Wireless and ultra-compact so you can take Bose sound anywhere* Built-in speakerphone lets you take calls out loud* Voice prompts talk you through Bluetooth pairing, so it's super easy* Lithium-ion battery plays up to 10 hours on full charge",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Eric Andrei","Let me start off by saying that I am both a tech junkie and music lover. Sorry, no audio industry experience or sound engineer degrees to tout here, I'm just a guy who likes music and stereos. Everything from HiFi systems to desktop speakers to PA gear to little bluetooth speakers like this Bose Soundlink Mini II.Here's what we need to clear off the plate before we get started. This is a $200 speaker designed to be portable, and should be treated as such. There are critical reviews in here that are pegging this speaker next to sound systems that do not even serve the same purpose as the Bose SoundLink Mini II. I have a few other systems to serve other purposes in my life: a Bower & Wilkins + McIntosh stereo system, KRK Rokit Monitors, just to name the two most enjoyed setups I have.But here's the thing. I needed something portable. Sleek. Reliable. Something I could carry around my apartment from my bedroom to my kitchen to my bathroom. And that same speaker needed to have the ability to be thrown into my backpack when I go to my girlfriend's house or off to a friend's place for the weekend. I looked at other speakers, such as the Beats Pill and UE Boom. Which did I like best? The Bose SoundLink Mini II. I'm not a Bose fan, it's just not in my pedigree. I had a few products from Bose in the past and simply wasn't impressed by the hype (Bose 3-2-1, the original noise cancelling headphones, Bose 802 Series II PA/DJ speakers).The SoundLink Mini II has since removed my brand bias. It's simply amazing. And to make a long story short, I love it. My roommate had the previous generation SoundLink Mini and I enjoyed connecting my iPhone to it when we had social gatherings in our old loft apartment. Back then it filled the living room with more than enough sound with 10 people in the room to converse over. I have since moved to a smaller apartment, but needed something I could listen to in all rooms of my current living space- something I could not do with my KRK Rokit 5 setup which I would connect to via AirPlay.This little speaker provides great sound, albeit a bit too bassy for my taste. Solution: I set the Spotify EQ to ""Bass Reduction"" and the output is just where I want it to be. I listen to all genres of music, but 70% of the time focus my attention on electronic, Top40, and Hip Hop, and this speaker does just the thing for me. The added convenience of a Micro USB charging port as well as dual bluetooth connection makes using this speaker so much easier than the last version. Happy to see Bose listened to the critics before releasing their second revision of the speaker.I have had this speaker for a mere 4 days and am very happy with it. I purchased the OEM Bose rubber bumper case for it, as well as a third party soft case, and now I'm ready to bring this where ever I need to go. It's the perfect tool for a city dweller on the run like myself, but this is easily at home on any kitchen countertop or office desk.Don't hesitate to purchase this- the other speakers in its class (key point when comparing this speaker) simply cannot compete with the Bose. Sure, you can buy the cheaper UE Boom 2, but it's also cheaper in build quality and aesthetics. Leave the UE Boom for college freshman. For those of us who have matured a bit and enjoy both elegant design language and good sound quality out of such a small, portable unit, go for the Bose. You absolutely will not regret it! Happy listening, Eric.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Amazon Customer","The sound quality is fine. But for $200+, I would expect it to be louder. Demand more from companies at this price point.",3
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","All I Do Is Nguyen","Bose is a well known name and this speaker lives up to their reputation. Great sounding speakers with excellent bass and volume. I have always heard that bluetooth speakers do not sound as good as wired speakers but this is not true. This speaker has exceptional sound quality. The battery can last a full day and the speaker looks modern and sleek. Only thing I dislike is the voice notifies you of disconnects and connects. It has one volume and can't be turned off which can be loud at night when you're trying to be quiet. If the price was lower this would be the ultimate portable speaker.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","jovigirl","I bought this as a bundle with the echo dot and the philips hue A9 starter kit, the speaker for me and the lights for my husband, This little guy has amazing sound quality and was pretty easy to pair with the Dot. I'm no tech person and will admit it took me a bit longer to figure it out then it should have but still not to bad and was well worth it. I love it and can now take the great sound with me anyplace in the house or outside.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Lollygagging","I'm not a stereo expert by any means, which is why I spent as long as I did looking for the right compact speaker to go with my computer. I listen to music while I work and wanted something that had good sound quality but wouldn't take up too much space. This Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II works perfectly. It fits in the space beneath my 24"" Mac Monitor with inches to spare but doesn't skimp on sound quality. I also got the metallic one, which looks great! It's also linked to my iPhone and works well when I want to bring it to other parts of my apartment. I have experienced some interference when it's connected to my Macbook Pro for music and I move it too far away, but I think that's more a result of Bluetooth than this speaker.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Anthoy F. Stefani","Bose does it again. I tried the Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II out in the store before Christmas and compared it to other similar brands. I trust Bose and own a couple pair of their noise cancelling headphones another original Sound Dock which, even though Bluetooth compatible, seems like a Woolly Mammoth compared to this cute speaker. This speaker puts out a  fantastic, crisp sound, the bluetooth has stayed synced to my computer and/or other devices and it rests on an inconspicuous charging cradle and has a USB charger as well. This speaker is in a large master bedroom at the moment but with the sound it puts out it could easily be placed in a kitchen, living room, dining room etc and you would still be satisfied with the volume and sound quality.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Kirby C","This speaker is incredible. People are always surprised to find out that such a small speaker has such high sound quality. Normally I wouldn't want to spend so much on a portable speaker, but my friend got one and after hearing how great it sounds I had to get it! Now my sister is buying one.We use it everywhere; at home, at the pool and at cook outs. The charge lasts a long time and it does't take long to recharge.I should mention that the first one we bought seemed to have been used and didn't hold a charge, so we returned it. The second one we bought came in packaging that clearly hadn't been opened. Word to the wise: don't let a seller pawn off defective merchandise on you. If you don't think it's working properly, return it.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Keith","Since I'm giving this product a 4-star review I'll lead by saying that this has amazing sound quality for its' size.  The highs are crisp, mid range is full and a lower volumes it even manages some respectable bass.  Further, I couldn't be happier with the design and quality of it.  The unit feels very sturdy and well made with premium finishes, minimal port intrusion, and the convenient docking station is phenomenal.  However, when you start to turn the volume up past 50% the bass drivers plateau and leave you wanting more.  Since I intend to use this speaker primarily around the house I would have preferred(and was expecting for the price) a larger/heavier speaker that could produce more bass than this manages.  That is my only criticism, for the price I wanted it to fill a bigger room.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much, but the reviews I'd read lead me to believe I'd get more out of this speaker, so hopefully I can serve to lower others' expectations to a more realistic level.",4
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Brett Citro","I am quite pleased with this little sound device! The sound quality is just as good, for mid range volume, as the large Sony system that I have below it in the photo! The balance between the highs and lows is actually better in my girlfriends opinion!Pro's:-Sound quality is far better than the any other Wireless BT speaker of comparable size. (Even better than the Beats Pill that my friend brought over, he even thought so.)-Interface is intelligent and fast, tells you whose phone it's connected to or disconnected from.-The speakers volume and iPhone volume move synchronously instead of two volume controls (different ones on the speaker and phone)Cons:-Single button control for play/pause, forward, reverse instead of individual controls for each.-Lower notes bottom out at higher volumes.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","cirqueme","This has become one of the best things I never knew I wanted until I had it.  The sound is amazing for such a small speaker - crisp highs, full-bodied lows, and excellent balance across the whole dynamic range.  I use this around the house when working on household tasks, and take it with us when we are spending the night away from home for music while going to bed.If you have concerns about how good could the sound possibly be from such a small unit, visit your local red-shirt or blue-shirt store and listen to the demo units.  The only other Bluetooth/battery-powered speaker that sounded any better (across all the brands/models on display) was the Bose SoundLink III (understandable, since it's a bigger unit).  The SoundLink Color has decent sound (a little flatter, slightly less clarity in the highs, slightly less fullness for everything else) for a lower price - if you need a less expensive option, it's a good one.  I liked the SoundLink Mini II over the III because you can charge it using the USB port, which makes it easy to charge anywhere, as USB chargers are inexpensive and common - just carry a USB cable (as opposed to a the small brick that the III uses).  Also, I chose the SoundLink Mini II over the Mini (original model) because the II adds hands-free speakerphone support when paired with your phone.The battery lasts about 5 hours cranked to the max (I used this for music in a 26' moving truck during a cross-country move), much longer at normal volumes.  Pairing is easy, and voice prompts can be disabled once you get used to using it.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Lara Coates","Best speaker ever, totally worth the price - even better if you manage to get it on sale - I got it on black Friday for $179. I've had mine a year and I bought another one as Christmas present for my in-laws .... who also love it! The quality is fantastic! I actually bought it for my wedding reception and it filled up the room wonderfully. It can go really loud without loosing sound quality, it also has a great balance between bass and treble. You can connect any music player/phone/laptop etc using an auxiliary lead or bluetooth.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Judi Bizzaro","I have got to tell you that I love, love, love this speaker. I received it on time, great packing and received what was promised. I do not have a radio so I use this in my car with my IPhone and what a great sound I get from it. I also use it outside while on my deck. Very clear sound. If your in the market for a portable Bluetooth speaker, this is the one to buy!!!",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Peter A. Butzin","This unit produces amazing sound for its size and weight. It's not audiophile quality, which would be too much to expect in such a small unit, at a reasonable price. I've bought several small, Bluetooth speakers. This one is the best I've encountered for such a small unit. It produces crisp highs, and decent bass.I also like the features, which include voice-actuated support for up to two Bluetooth devices, and a wireless charging stand.This is a first rate product, hardly the cheapest available, but it provides terrific value.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Luke Shiroda","Where do I start... This speaker is amazing. First, the speaker came packaged perfectly and arrived in mint condition. I charged it up and started using it very soon after. It is amazing. The quality and clarity are incredible. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great Bluetooth speaker. And it's very easy to pair and the wireless range is great.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Amazon Customer","I've been using this for about a year and am overall very happy with it.  Sound quality is excellent.  And I'm glad I ordered the protective case with it. My only gripe is that it will occasionally - and unexpectedly - disconnect from my devices, usually when I'm most excited to play/watch something and then I have to pause and fiddle around with buttons and settings until it reconnects and then I have to restart whatever I wanted to watch/listen to, and by then the excitement has turned to frustration and I'm about ready to hurl the speaker and/or device out the window.  Other than that, it sounds great!",4
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Aaron Dwoskin","The sound from this small speaker is spectacular. It produces great bass with well balances treble and is made with precision quality- it is surprisingly heavy. I enjoy the excellent battery life, sounds, tones, and volume range from this small speaker. My one gripe about the product, if I had to list one, is that there is sometimes ""Bluetooth studder"" or ""Bluetooth skip"" from my iPhone. This could be coming from my iPhone itself, but I have also noticed it on my iPad. I simply change the location of the device (which could be getting interference from something in my house) and it goes away. It is not enough of an issue to discourage me from loving this speaker, which is amazing!",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Amazon Customer","let me start by saying that this is obviously a return because the packet in which the charging port was in was opened already and the packet had some scratches and damage to it like someone had a struggle on opening it lol and the speaker was dead on arrival which shouldn't be if it wasn't used but I mean I have no problem with it being used but it bothers me because I really like the unboxing experience with products that I spend this much money on and just knowing that someone has return it just bothers me it makes me think that this speaker probably had some problems but great quality speaker overall. I think if you really want a new one guaranteed out of the manufacturer go to bose website or local store (target etc. )",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","M. Morrow","If you're just looking for loud, there are plenty of other bluetooth speakers that can get loud. You don't need a lot of cash to get loud.This unit was worth it to me because it can get loud and stay clear, where cheaper ones would start to distort. It's been used in my house to listen to music while taking a shower (it stays out of the shower of course), to listen while cleaning around the house, and even just hanging out on the patio. It has no trouble filling a room. With some streaming music services reaching up to 320kbps right now, the quality is very good.I haven't run into any battery performance issues. I've had it off the dock for a few hours at a pretty loud volume without it dying on me. When I was done with it, I just placed it back onto the dock. No worrying about plugging it in.The calling feature is nice too. When getting a call, it will pause the music and speak the name or number of the caller. Just push the button on the speaker and you can speak through it. I can hear others well through it, and they tell me they hear me normally.Overall, it's a nice little unit.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Steve Farley","What a nice surprise.  I was astounded at the clarity coming from this tiny speaker and so were many of my neighbors.  I've had 3 of my neighbors purchase this speaker after hearing it for themselves.  I live just outside of Phoenix and this time of year everyone tries to be outside as much as possible and alot of the time we spend outside is while we are entertaining.The Bose Mini II makes providing background music a snap.  Just take it outside, pick some tunes on the iPhone and pass out the beer and wine.  The quality and ease of setting this thing up has made me consider the Bose QC35 noise cancelling bluetooth headphones.  I'm thinking that if the Mini II is so good then maybe the QC35 will be just as good.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Allen","This speaker is pretty loud and i really enjoy it, but i must say one thing about it. I connected it to my Samsung Note 5 and occasionally it keeps saying it is connected to my phone but it wouldn't give out any audio. All you would see is my track playing and my phone would recognize that it is also connected to the speaker... but no audio. At first i thought maybe it was my phone until i had tried it out with an iPhone 6. The same issue happened and i don't know why. I've been having it for 3 months now and the problem comes and goes. (once or twice every week). It doesn't do it all the time but when it does, it's pretty frustrating to deal with it. I paid 200 dollars for this product and i would expect it to work perfectly fine. Don't get me wrong, i still love it. Everyone that has seen and heard it are pretty impressed by it. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't to have been for that one issue. I use it on a daily basis for my office or for my bedroom and its pretty cool to say that this little box can be very loud. I see a ton of co-workers that have Bluetooth speakers but when they raise it up above 50 percent of the volume, the speakers sound like they want to pop. Not only that but they buy 80 dollar ones that break down and they have to buy another one. This Bose speaker sounds and looks like it is made out very good material. It also has some weight to it which i like because it looks like it can take a fall to ground and still function good. The battery last maybe 8 hours for me on Bluetooth when its really loud. The auxiliary cord last me almost 3 times longer. not sure how long but i actually forgot that i had to charge this box lol. Hopefully this review is good enough for you to decide if you really want to buy this product.",4
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","B52Gunner","Bose speakers are not cheap but, they are simply the best!  I wouldn't own any others!  The sound that comes from this little gem is incredible!  Worth every penny!",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Joe M.","Sound quality is excellent, as is expected from a Bose product. The lows and mids out of this thing are INCREDIBLE given it's very small form factor. The reason for 3 stars is the interface. Any interaction with the power, bluetooth and volume buttons warrants a ridiculously loud audible response. As an example: any time you connect or disconnect a device via bluetooth, it will verbally inform you "" USER'S iPhone connected/disconnect"". The volume at which it does this is insanely loud....a simple and subtle beep would have sufficed. Secondly, the charging base user experience is terrible. For as simple as the design is, there isn't very good tactile feedback as to whether it has ""nested"" properly in the base and starts receiving a charge. The lip of the charger base needs to be a bit more substantial.",3
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Lou Howort","If I could  rate this higher I would.  It's a wonderful product in every way. It's smaller than I thought it would be and is very easy to carry around from room to room. It pairs with my phone instantly with no hassles. And the sound? For a speaker this size – fantastic! Yesterday my wife was listening to music,when I walked  into the room she was in.  I thought it was too loud  and walked over to a larger music system in the room to lower the sound but  it did not get lower. I asked my wife if there was something wrong with it and she laughed and said ""that machine is not on, it's the Bose speaker.""  I was, and still am, amazed that such a small speaker could have sound with an almost live presence to it.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Dr Vig","I have used bose products for years they are a solid company when it comes to sound reproduction. I have had the soundlink mini 1 for a while and it works great, however, the first mini 2 I got it would not turn on after talking with bose and attempted to fix it found it was just a bad speaker. Contacted Amazon and had a replacement the next day. With that said still 5 stars this speaker is awesome especially for its size both Bose and Amazon were great. It throws out a lot of base if you place it next to a wall you get the best sound. Battery seams to last had it on loud for around 5 hrs or so no problem. It is heavy for its size you will not mistake this for a cheep reproduction speeker like the beats overpriced garbage. On sale its about 100 bucks but it is well worth double that.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","T J A","This speaker fell from the roof of my Blazer while I was driving 50mph. It wacked the ground hard and started to somersault and shed pieces and still plays music like it did before. DON'T LEAVE THIS SPEAKER ON TOP OF A MOVING VEHICLE.",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","Elizabeth K. Clarke","This little speaker rocks. I've never had a portable speaker that actually delivers on the bass end of the sound spectrum. I love how deep and rich the sound is. It has a good Bluetooth range. You can hear it from several rooms of my house. Beyond easy to set up and use. I also like that you can place it on the charging plate to charge instead of having to plug it in. Recommend!",5
"Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)","BRtF","Update 30 May 2017:  I'm degrading one star for a few reasons:  One, the speakers will not turn on if left alone for a certain period of time.  The only way to get them to respond again is to put them on the charge.  This is a problem if you just grab your charged speakers with plans to use them and you don't bring along charging provisions.  Second thing:  When plugged into my 12V power point in my vehicle, the charging stops/starts every few seconds causing the hi-lo lo-hi beep which is distracting.  This doesn't happen when plugged into USB via AC power either with my USB charging hub or with the one Bose supplied.  The 12V (Anker) power point in the car works very well to charge other devices, just not these speakers which isn't good when I plug them into the car when we're camping.  Upgraded the firmware, the charging issue persists, haven't had time to check the responsiveness issue mentioned above.This will probably get buried under existing reviews, but in case a Google search for Bose Soundlink 2 versus Anker Premium speakers brings you here, here is what I wrote about the Anker speakers for the three star review I left:The Bose Soundlink 2s win, hands down.  The difference in sound is worth the extra $140 to me and I will keep them.  I tested them by putting both speaker sets on a table right in front of me.  I used two identical iPhones paired to both speakers in order to play identical .mp3s.  I'd start one, stop it, start the same song on the other and just flip flop.  I did this for over an hour and this is what I found:The Bose are simply brighter and clearer than the Anker.  There is really only a certain sound range that speakers this size can play well and the Bose does it better.  It really shined through on songs like ""AxelF"" and ""Seven Bridges Road"".  Bass, as in bass guitar is louder and clearer on the Bose, a good example of that is ""Into the Mystic"".  The Anker has a little more thumping bass like from a bass drum with ""Thrift Shop"" but not much more.  If the song has any high end hiss, you will hear it more with the Bose than the Anker as the Anker is generally more muffled.  So, I'll give the Ankers to a family member since Anker issued me a refund (I didn't ask for it).  Again, the Ankers represent their price bracket well.  Truly a case of getting what's paid for.",4
