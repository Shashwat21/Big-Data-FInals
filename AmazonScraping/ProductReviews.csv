"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","MissOliviaP","I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. First of, let's start off by pointing out the obvious, it's under $100. You're not going to receive a Kindle Paperwhite. Before you order, read the specs and compare it to the other Kindles. Yes, the specs say it doesn't have backlighting so honestly, there shouldn't be one ounce of surprise when you receive this. I on the other hand, love this little Kindle. I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite and I really didn't like how big it was to hold in my small hands. I don't have children hands, but I'm a female and my hands are on the small side. Maybe for a male this would be kind of small, Idk. Anyway, it is smaller than the Paperwhite, but I love that. I also love the fact that it doesn't come with a light. I used to read at night with the Paperwhite, but that light gave me a headache so I stopped. It is NOT as dark as these bad reviews make it seem. You can read perfectly fine being indoors. They're exaggerating. This feels more like a book to me than the Kindle Paperwhite ever did. The letters on this Kindle are amazing. I don't even notice the difference between ppi and I love that the letters are way darker than the Paperwhite. The paperwhite had a grey hue to them and I didn't feel like I was reading a book. I felt like I actually holding a technical device to read a book. Of course since this doesn't have a backlight, you cannot read in the dark. It's common sense. If you want to read at night, purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindle. It's not a big deal and you're not going to break the bank buying a $119.99 item when you can buy this little awesome e-book reader for $79.99. Think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e-books... you will be back to square one and will either have to purchase a new kindle or buy a light for your expensive kindles. You can increase the letter size if you're reading at night with indoor lights and you can read perfectly. It has airplane mode, web search, Goodreads, Amazon store, and bluetooth.So far I haven't had any issues at all. Pages have gone back and fourth perfectly fine. The bookmark tool works like a charm. I love it more than the kindle paperwhite. You can connect your Goodreads account on it, too. I actually use the bluetooth like a audiobook. It reads it for me! Yeah, it sounds a little robotic but it's not anything that bothers me. I love how I can still download PDF documents into it and it opens and works AMAZING! I honestly recommend this e-book reader to anyone that doesn't want to spend over $100 on one. You will not regret it. The battery lasts me a very long while as well. Disconnect it from the internet and bluetooth to save you battery.Thanks Amazon for coming out with such an inexpensive E-book and it's great for the price!! Love it 100%!HOW TO CONNECT IT TO READ OUT LOUD:1. Connect your Kindle to a Bluetooth available device (laptop, speaker, headphone, etc.)2. Once connected to bluetooth go to your Kindle Settings -> Device Options -> Personalize Your Kindle -> VoiceView Screen Reader and turn it ON3. DoneGo back home and click on a book and it will automatically read out loudBy the way, this is my opinion. I'm not a paid reviewer or anything. Just want to help others out, lol. :)",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Sara Krzykowski","There are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here, so I though I would add my positive one.I had a second-generation Kindle many years ago, and it has since stopped working. I finally decided to buy a new one.I chose the basic Kindle because that's exactly what I wanted -- a bare-bones e-reader. I have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort. This Kindle delivers on that front in every way possible.At first, I thought I would miss the page turn buttons, and dislike the touch screen. However, I have been delightfully surprised. Tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button, which was always a nice little jarring reminder that I wasn't, in fact, reading a paperback. The small, quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and I don't notice it anymore; it feels natural.I do slightly miss the metal backing of the older Kindles; it made them feel a bit sturdier, whereas this basic Kindle is just hard plastic. However, I suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably, and I feel that the cheaper price of this basic Kindle far outweighs that slight drawback.I bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers. I do not want ads intruding my Kindle experience, even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the Home screen. It is just distasteful to me, and the extra 30$ was worth it to me to avoid the ads.I do not need or want a case for my Kindle. I do not like to read with a case on, and it would be cumbersome to remove my Kindle from its case every time I want to read. That being said, this version of Kindle does seem quite fragile, as mentioned before, so when I carry it with me in my purse, I am covering it with a knit beanie hat for now. Eventually I will buy a small soft pouch to store it in; I have seen them for sale here on Amazon.Even though the Kindle seems fragile, the size and weight of the device is a definite advantage while reading. It is so comfortable to hold that it just disappears in your hand and you forget that you are reading from an electronic device. It really is a cool experience.As to the complaints of the screen being dim--it is no dimmer than previous generation Kindles. No, there is no back light. It looks just like a printed page, and can be read easily in all lighting conditions -- whether by lamp or by sunlight. If you find that you are straining your eyes, you can simply adjust the size, font, and spacing of the text to something that better fits your eyes. I personally do not read in bed with the lights off -- I fall asleep while reading like that. However if you are a frequent bed-time reader, you will want to get the Paperwhite, Voyager, or Oasis models.If you've never had a Kindle before, why should you get one? Simple...anyone who loves to read should get one. Now, which model is your personal choice; I have already explained why I love this one. Amazon has millions upon millions of books that are able to be purchased and downloaded to the device. A good fourth of those available are free, and another good chunk are $2 or less. So if the price of the device itself makes you hesitate, it can easily end up paying for itself if you read a lot of free or cheap titles.More and more titles become available for Kindle every day -- when I got my original 2nd Gen Kindle nine years ago, the Harry Potter series was unavailable to Kindle. Now with my new device, it is. The Half-Blood Prince is the first book I downloaded for my new Kindle, since that is where I am at in the series right now, and I could not be happier. They even preserved the chapter illustrations for the e-reader format.Kindle has the ability to store thousands of books, so you shouldn't have to worry about running out of storage. If you do, however, the overflow can be stored on Amazon's Cloud service, so you never have to worry about giving up any of your old favorites. Kindle also gives you the ability to highlight passages, make notes, and bookmark pages. Your Kindle will also always remember what page you left off at, in every book that you have stored on it. Kindle also has the ability to look up words in the dictionary or thesaurus. It really brings reading to a whole new level.Well, that about sums up my review of this model of Kindle, and Kindles in general. To put it simply, this Kindle does what it is advertised to do, and does it, in my opinion, flawlessly. If you want a tablet or a reader with a back light, stay away. If you are new to Kindle and/or want something basic, this is a great device to start with.",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Dina","I was so shocked! So, I was going through a book for my PhD dissertation, highlighting parts for further citations in my project. When I was done with it, I realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e-book, looking for the highlights, I can just export them to my e-mail in PDF file. This is life changing for me! I have always preferred paper books to e-books, but this option is a miracle. It saved me hours of work! I am a very happy customer!",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Michael Gallagher","I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at $79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because $119 to $289+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at $79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thinner and lighter than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my previous version of the same model the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read and the display is crisp. Looking at the display side-by-side in the same location of an eBook against the prior version of Kindle mentioned above, the text on this Kindle is much darker and reads a lot better. Compared to a Paperwhite it is not as dark but those results are to be expected since the Paperwhite has 80%4+ more pixels per inch, but at this price point that's not too big of a concern for me as each new version of the Kindle gets better and better with the fonts and screen display and this one is pretty darn good - you want to be able to read what you're supposed to, right?If you like the text-to-speech feature of previous Kindle models or listened to music with your Kindle Keyboard as an example, please be aware there are no speakers nor is there a plug for headphones.In comparison to the previous version of Kindle this one is replacing, other than the crisper text / fonts from the improved screen display, as far as I can tell this new version of Kindle has the same technical specifications of the previous Kindle: about the same size, same internal memory. If you had a precious version of the Kindle this version is replacing, that means you can use the same cover as the previous version.Battery life is supposed to last ""...weeks on a single charge"" but I doubt it: I charged it up 100% late yesterday afternoon and, 18 hours later, the battery meter is indicating about 75% left. This was after reading for a couple of hours with the Wi-Fi left on but the Kindle not being used overnight as I left it in sleep mode. Time will tell if this is going to be a problem or not.It did take a few minutes to get this model up and running as you first need to connect it to a WiFi connection (this model does not have 3G capability) in addition to the normal making sure it is registered and going through a mandatory tutorial on which areas of the screen to tap to perform various functions.  There is a lot of Amazon marketing you have to weed through: do you want to sign up for Goodreads (an Amazon affiliate), would you like to sign up for Kindle Unlimited (for a monthly recurring revenue stream to Amazon), would you like to link your Facebook and Twitter accounts so your're friends / family / perfect strangers can be voyeuristic on what you are reading (absolutely not for me).  You can also sign up for parental controls with this version which I think is a great idea - sometimes you don't want your children to read what you are reading.Once you have gone through the registration process, if you have previously identified your books into collections this Kindle will perform an automatic import of the various categories / collections you have linked to your Amazon account and links to the books in the Cloud that you can immediately download in the same category on the new Kindle. If you're replacing an older Kindle with this one that could be handy, but if you have other people on your account / family in households with more than one Kindle, that can be a pain in the neck because, for example, my wife and children generally have different tastes in books - I don't want her books cluttering up my Kindle's screen and she feels the same way about mine. IT's not a deal killer, but it does make you wade through a lot of stuff.  One note of caution – if you do a large download of your books from the Cloud to this new Kindle an indexing process will occur.  That will chew up the battery as the Kindle indexes words / phrases in each title imported so you can search for it later.  I haven’t downloaded all of my titles yet, but will do it right before I go to bed one night – with the Kindle connected to a charger so the battery won’t drain down real fast.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter.  Also, if you like reading at night you will need a separate light or be reading in a well-lit room as there is not a built-in backlight like the Kindle Paperwhite.Despite some of my nits above, as a parent whose children can be hard on electronics I like this version, and think with this $79 price point it will help to continue to explode the eBook revolution even faster as they get in more people's hands. If you have not purchased a Kindle before due to price, need a cheaper replacement than the other versions, or maybe a relative or a friend has hesitated to get one this one is in your price zone, I would recommend this one!",4
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Deann","This new Kindle is great!  We are a Kindle loving family.  This new version feels lighter and looks sleek.  It's also slightly smaller than the previous generation (which one of my children own).Two of my children upgraded their older versions (Kindle Touch and Kindle 4th Gen) for this new 8th Gen Kindle.  My son hung on to that Kindle Touch for so long because of the text to speech capabilities.  He was excited to learn about the new VoiceView text to speech capabilities and also thrilled to buy his own bluetooth earbuds.  Naturally this was the first thing he tried out when the Kindle arrived today.  I was dismayed to discover that no Parental Controls can be turned on at the same time as Voice View...  Neither can Freetime be turned on at the same time as VoiceView.I would really appreciate a software update in the future and will update if that happens, but for now I'm quite frustrated to find my son can't use Voice View unless he also has parental controls off (which allows him access to the experimental browser, the Kindle store, the cloud, and Goodreads).*Update*:  We've now had the new 8th Gen. Kindles for 6 days.  My son has figured out that while Parental Controls are on he CAN use VoiceView, but it takes some work.  He goes through the pairing instructions and turns on VoiceView, which does not work the first time.  He goes through the process a second time and it will work.  Mom is happy, child is happy, so I've upgraded the review to 5 stars.  A software update would still be nice to avoid the extra step.",5

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","rpv","I got this as a gift and very impressed with the Kindle on the lower end of the spectrum. I have a Kindle Paperwhile, and though I cannot directly compare with it due to their different price points and specs, I will say of you have few more $$ go for the paperwhite. The 300 ppi on the paperwhite does make a difference compared to the 167 ppi on the New Kindle. If you are on a budget this is absolutely perfect. My only request to Amazon is to build a 9” or 13” Kindle. It has definitely a market! I have ordered the 13” Android ereader from Goodereader.This Kindle has no built in lights and is lightweight. Only Kindle lighter than this is the Oasis! I login to my Amazon account and voila! All my books are present.  Feels very thin. If you are travelling and on metro trains most of the time, this is a no brainer. Kindles have come a long way in past several years! They feel light and are excellent for reading purpose. I will any day prefer this over any tablets. No eye strain, I am reading a book and it feels very pleasant with this device. I found one hand reading a breeze! The software has improved leaps and bounds in past few years and I am totally impressed with Amazon’s execution. I still am not sure why Amazon does not include a one dollar wall charger. Someone’s going to fry connecting to a wrong charger.In general the Kindle is a great first foray for ereaders. I have been reading on ereaders for past 6 years and this Kindle has come a long way! If you have last year’s model, do you need to upgrade. Well No. I have a several year old generation. Do I need to upgrade to this. Well Yeah! Reading becomes so much more pleasurable. I have a policy that I do not use a tablet an hour before sleep, but I exempt Kindle as they have no glaring light coming out of it.If you have any questions please ask and I will answer in the comments section within 24 hours.",4

I have it linked to my Bluetooth speaker and the books are read out loud to me.  The connection sometimes drops but that is because I sometimes don't have it close enough to the speaker.  There is no light on this device but that is not an issue since, I really need the text to speech rather than a better visual.  It's a great inexpensive reader that allows me to have my books with me without having to lug a bunch of paperback or hardbacks around with me.  It is a fantastic entry level reader and beats some of the others since, it does have the text to speech function.",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","G. Johnston","Used to have the Kindle DX.  Loved it because it was big enough that I wasn't constantly hitting page turn (I'm a fast reader).  But that died last year.  I just got this new one, and, although it took some getting used to, I love it just as much.  Switching from the page turn button to a swipe of the screen took some getting used to, but other than that, the experience is fantastic.  This is a lot thinner than my klunky old DX, but the screen is also a LOT smaller, so I swipe often.  I originally toyed with the idea of getting the version with the Whispersync ability for the $100 extra, but when thinking about it, the only places I will be reading books (home, vacation or public transport) all have ready access to open wifi.  I was at the beach this weekend without wifi and wanted a book, but was able to use the phone as a hotspot and download, so, again, didn't need the Whispersync.  Funny, when I had the DX, I couldn't live without the Whispersync.  Now, I feel like it would have been a waste of my money.  Personal choice, though.  If you've got the extra $100 and don't mind springing for it, go ahead.I would recommend this Kindle.  I bought one of the silicone covers and am very happy with it.",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","JavaJoe","Just started using it and it's a keeper. That said, it doesn't 100% meet every expectation since I have a couple of books purchased from Kindle store that are the text book type (scanned pages, not just text) and those books are not compatible with the Kindle. You need a smartphone or tablet with the Amazon Kindle app to read - not even Cloud reader can display the content which is annoying if you just have a small phone. Theoretically, the Fire line would be better for the text books (though I don't own one and not sure), but I wanted the e-ink display for my eyes and battery life.Aside from that the standard Kindle books and even sideloading PDF documents work. The screen is not as crisp as it could be, but this is the entry model and I really just wanted it for the e-ink and sans-backlight which it has. It is more comfortable on my eyes compared to a standard LCD/AMOLED display with a backlight and price is competitive if you look at other iPads or tablets (though the functionality of those options and hardware capabilities does blow the Kindle out of the water).The Kindle reader is a good, lightweight device if you want a dedicated device, buy your books from the Kindle store in the standard format and you want to have the e-ink experience.",4
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Tom Olsen","This is the first Kindle I've ever owned, so I cannot say how it compares to previous models. What I can say is that I really enjoy using my kindle. I like the idea of an ebook as a way of saving paper and offering a lower cost method of reading (ebook are generally cheaper). I've tried reading on tablets with bright LED backlight displays, I've tried reading on my computer, and even on my phone. These solutions typically ended in my having a headache. This screen is a pleasure to read from, and leaves me wanting to read more. I know its the lower end in terms of contrast and ppi that Amazon offers, but it seems to do the job just fine, and I don't notice any eye strain.I'm impressed with the overall design. It is very thin and light; perfect if you want to take it on the go. I ride my bike to work everyday, and i am able to slip this into one of my larger pockets no problem. The only downside to the slim design is that i often don't know quite which way to hold it and be comfortable without accidentally hitting the screen and flipping the page. I imagine if I had a case this wouldn't be as much of a problem.The touchscreen seems responsive enough, and I generally am able to select the right button the first time. However, it seems that sometimes when I am trying to flip the page left, I somehow manage to flip right. This can be a bit disorienting and cause me to flip back and forth to find my spot.",4

No way could I pass up that deal even though I love my Paperwhite.The most obvious difference is this Kindle has no built in light, but you can use almost any clip on light. I'm repurposing my old Nook light, which works well. No it doesn't light up the screen as evenly as Paperwhite's built in light.The basic Kindle is a tad bit lighter, but it doesn't have the soft matte backing like the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite feels much better in your hands. This one is all hard plastic like the 2015 Fire.This has all the same reading options as the Paperwhite. Plus it has an additional font option called Amazon Ember, which is a welcome addition.Amazon has finally added their version of TTS, which is called Voiceview. Since there are no built in speakers you will need a blue tooth speaker to activate Voiceview. It is a nice feature, but don't expect for it to sound like a professional narrated ""audible"" book.The Paperwhite is much better in poorly lit areas. No messing around with a clip on light. However, the addition of Voiceview is an awesome feature that does come in handy.",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","curlygrl","What do I want in an e-book?  I want it to be my go-to book for all my fun-loving, easy-reading books.  Things one might read when is relaxing and one's brain does not have to work too hard...sunning by the pool, (carefully) taking a bath, lazing around before going to sleep.  I do and have done for quite some time, all of these things with paper books, and also with my first Kindle...which I had for 6 years. I tried out my first Kindle (""Kindle Keyboard"") in early 2011.  It wasn't perfect -- No matter what search feature it said it had, it never was very productive at searching my long list of books.  And as it got older, it started getting stuck and needing restart.  But I really liked it overall...and then it got stuck, never to get unstuck.  So I had to buy a new Kindle.  If you want touch-screen, you're in luck.  I think all versions are touch screens these days.  Personally, I did not want one.  There were 4 variations available, and I chose this one, which seemed the most pared down (few extras), the simplest...the closest one to my previous Kindle or a paper book.  It arrived, and I immediately noticed that the actual size of the Kindle got smaller.  The screen size appears to be the same, but without the arrow buttons on each side (left and right edges) and without the keyboard below the screen...the whole size of the Kindle has shrunk.  Again...this is in comparison to my 2011 Kindle.  But to put this in perspective, the dimensions of its face is smaller than most paperback books.  I am a 5'2"" woman and I have average enough hand size for my height.  When I place the base of the palm of my hand (above the wrist) on the bottom edge of this new Kindle's front surface, with my hand comfortably resting on top (fingers naturally spreading) the tips of my fingers reach beyond the top edge, and the same happens with the tips of my pinky and thumb fingers to the side.  I find the degree of change in the size of the object to be problematic for my comfort...particularly because of the touch screen.  There is very little front surface area that is not screen...so there is very little ""safe"" area that I can place my fingers.  And if I'm reclining and attempting to not work too hard at reading, what happens is that I end up touching the darned touch screen.  It pages when I don't want to page...sometimes several pages in succession.  Then I have to sort that out, and then get back into my reading.  Ultimately, this is a huge flaw in this e-reader's construction for me and how I use it. I think that, as it is now, it is best suited for reading while utilizing a flat surface for its presentation...like sitting at a table or desk, or using a reading stand or pillow.  I understand that touch screens are huge now, so they really had to make a product with this.  But I didn't want it with that.  I really wish that they had made their pared down Kindle with a way to turn off the touch screen function, and with the arrow buttons on the edges as before.  Actually, even without the keyboard I wish that they made this Kindle have more front surface area, because it isn't all that fun to hold onto because it's small and dainty.  I even buffed mine up a bit with a folding cover to make it more like a book (which would have the extra benefit of keeping the very responsive touch screen from getting accidentally touched while in my purse, etc).  And even with that I find it just a bit too small for pleasure.  Along these lines, it also seems like that the default listing of book titles is by an artistic overlay of covers of the more recent books in my Kindle usage / purchase list.  I haven't used this Kindle enough to know if this is a function that can be adjusted.  Personally I rather preferred looking at a the list of titles in the old one...although it would be nice to be able to add thumbnail options to that or sort thru the list in a variety of ways.  The old Kindle wasn't very functional in that way.  Ultimately, because this new Kindle hasn't allowed me to enjoy my reading it during my most relaxed times, I have only used it for about 3-4 books...one of which I was only halfway thru reading when the previous Kindle died on me.  So it's more like I've read about 2-3 books on this new Kindle in the _3 months_ I've owned it.  Hey, for some people that would be a pretty good showing.  But for me?  Well I won the MS ReadAThon in my school two years running...both 2nd and 3rd grades...you know, back in the day.  And with my previous Kindle I could read a lot of my...summer reading books, one might say...pretty quickly; I went thru 1700+ books in the 6 years I had the last one.  So, yes, this is making a huge difference.  I've gone back to mostly reading paper books now.  My new Kindle is a decorative paperweight on my desk.  Well it's decorative in the cover I chose for it.  But I rarely use it.  Other people may not read with their Kindle in the same way that I do...or they may not read with it enough for it to be terribly problematic...or maybe they do, but it just doesn't bug them as much as it does me.  But in the case that you are a bit of a reading addict like me and this little quirk of the e-reader would bother you...now you know.",2

I know it's easier on my eyes than the computer screen and, as much as I hate to say it, I believe it's a bit easier on my eyes than real books. I have the font size quite small - accidentally changed it while still getting used to the touch screen and found the small size to be better than the default. Just as with real books, in bright light it's readable without my reading glasses; in dimmer light it's just fine with the glasses. I purchased a clip-on light at the same time as the Kindle, after reading the Kindle reviews, but haven't found it necessary to use (found other uses, though, so that wasn't a waste of money).I also purchased a case and have found it makes the Kindle much easier to hold. With the case it can be held like a real book, which is great when I want one hand free for cookies while I read! I think a case might also fix the problem some people have had with the power button. I can stand the Kindle up and it doesn't affect it at all.Battery seems to be fine, no problems with it holding a charge. I have Kindle versions of some old 18th & 19th century cookbooks and ""ladies' work"" books that I flipped through fairly fast just to see how the formatting came out. In those cases, I did notice the battery was going down. So yes, the more page-turning you do, the more it uses up a charge.This is also my first touch screen, which I find very easy to use as long as I use just a light tap. Otherwise, yes it does flip through an extra page (or several...). Accessing all the menus and such is a breeze.Then there's all the features, like notes and bookmarks and more. Won't go into that since I've not tried everything yet - too busy reading the books, heh - but there's plenty of stuff there to use when I get into the books for which those features will be useful.Oh, and since I'm usually into several books at a time, the fact that I can take a bunch of books in my over-stuffed purse or workbag and not have to choose which book until I'm ready to read, well, it just makes life that much more pleasant.

It did what I wanted with grace.The touchscreen on the new Kindle makes it harder to hold the device without accidentally flipping pages.or doing other undesired actions. The UI appears to have been (badly) designed by a committee to do everything but help you read books. I've even found that I have one book that is stored on the device but doesn't always appear in the Home directory. I want a simple reader. If I wanted a flakey device that eats battery, I'd get a Kindle Fire.<Original review>This is my third version of the basic small e-ink Kindle, first with a touchscreen. The last two needed replacing because the e-ink screen died (not from abuse, so they must just go bad after a year or two). The UI has changed quite a bit from the much simpler version in the other Kindles, which is at best a mixed benefit. The touchscreen is also a mixed benefit - typing is much easier with the touchscreen, but it has a tendency to change pages inadvertently, either because I brush it, or the cat's tail does, or... Also, the battery seems to drain quicker with the touchscreen, and if I'm out in the sun, page turns on the newer screen are visible less sharp as the device gets warmer, something that didn't happen before. But the new device has nicer fonts. So where four stars would have been ""just as good"" as earlier Kindles, and five would have been ""significantly improved, this gets three.",2

Unfortunately, due to space constraints both in my backpack and in my dorm room, it's unfortunately very impractical for me to carry around books, especially hardcover books. I purchased this in October when it was on a promotion, and it's been doing its job well. The interface itself is pretty straightforward, and there's a bit of a lag, but I mean, it's supposed to be for storing and reading books. I love how lightweight and comfortable it is to read. I was worried about the touchscreen being not sensitive, but I actually find that it responds pretty well--actually, my hair's caused the page to turn, oops.I hate reading on laptop screens or my phone screen, and I find that although you have to use an external light source to read, it's easy on the eyes so I can read for hours without getting a headache. I can also read right before bed without worrying about screen light affecting my sleep/brain!I will say that there is a small mark--almost like a smudge of e-ink--and while sometimes it can be annoying, it poses no serious problem. It's probably my own fault for dropping it a couple of times.In terms of battery life, I'm very satisfied. It charges pretty quickly and if you use it everyday, it'll last a pretty long time. I don't think it necessarily lasts weeks with constant use. Standby, it lasts weeks, though.Overall I love my Kindle. I put off buying one because I was a ""it's not a REAL book nothing will beat a real book I love the feel of a REAL BOOK"" snob, but I've been converted. I really enjoy e-readers.",5

My 1st generation Kindle still works but was giving me problems with the on/off switch so I bought the newest model. It took some getting used to because of its smaller size. It's very easy to drop when I get a little drowsy.The software seems a bit quirky for the touch screen, sometimes losing my place in a book by a few pages. I had to review the manual provided online plus search online to figure out why the reading location percentage at the bottom of the screen disappeared so I could turn the feature back on. I don't think the battery life, while very good, is as good as my original Kindle.These are small quibbles with an excellent and inexpensive e-reader. I like the way it came already integrated into my Amazon account. It was easy to select titles from ""Manage Content and Devices"" to be downloaded onto the new device.

It feels lighter than a book and the cover actually makes it easier to hold in one hand like you would a real book with the cover bent back. Natural to hold, without the fatigue of a heavier device. The screen is crisp and clear. I can read for hours without fatigue. I really like the new Bookerly font too.

I mostly use my kindle for my reading obsession so I didn't need all the extra stuff the new kindle fires have. I have also heard that the light from the screens on phones and Kindles are bad for your eyes and I just recently had to get glasses. I always have the brightness on all of my devices at the lowest, so if you buy this new Kindle be warned that it is much darker than the lowest brightness setting on your phone. It takes a little getting used to but I don't actually find it hard to read and I'm not one to read under a lamp, so I don't really have a problem with it. The only thing that is kind of annoying to me is that on the home screen it's a little hard to make out the book titles when your looking for one and I'm used to them being in color. When I took the kindle out if it's box I was a little surprised at how small it was, I guess I didn't really think about how big 6"" is, it's only about an inch taller than my phone , but I find that I like the size because it's very light and easy to hold.

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","JTHeyman","As a Kindle, it is badly flawed in a few ways. The plastic used for the case is slippery, making it hard to hold unless you buy a case for the case (Amazon trying to get more money rather than designing for use as-is?). The power switch is a push button on the bottom, so you can't rest it on a table while reading (or on any surface) or it turns off. It might be ""glare-free"" but I can't read it if a light source is shining directly on it; it has to be angled (not sure what glare-free means in context).  Loading stories on it from non-Amazon-site sources is difficult at best (harder than it used to be) and requires a lot more work than the older Kindle did. (Is Amazon trying to force people to buy books only from Amazon?  If so, do it and stop using functionality problems to do it surreptitiously.)  The ""downloads"" vs. ""documents"" division on the screen is worthless and confusing.  Despite many years, you STILL can't attach the Kindle to a computer and move stories into folders quickly and easily, rather than having to go through dozens or hundreds of files and carefully check the boxes to put them in a folder one at a time.  If my older model Kindle hadn't died, I'd have returned to using it rather than this one.And on a personal note, I despise touchscreen since you have to mar the screen to use it and you don't dare touch the screen while reading or weird things will happen (highlighting or menus or changing pages when you don't want).  But some people like touchscreen, so I leave that to the buyer's preference.However, it's not all bad.  The new model is smaller (fits in a pocket).  The screen is clear and easy to read.  The expanded fonts make changing the text for reading ease a better experience.  And it's a Kindle which does what it's supposed to: let you read electronic books, saving a ton of space in your library.It's a Kindle, but not a good one.  If I could afford to get another model, I would, but I'm afraid the other models would have the same problems as this one.  I don't use my Kindle as much as I used to, and I blame that on the new hardware design features more than anything else.  All I wanted was something to let me read books easily and without a lot of headaches.  My older Kindle model did that wonderfully.  This Kindle does NOT deliver on that actual need.",2

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Jim","I purchased the earlier version of this reader in Nov 2012.  While I also own a Kindle Paper-white and an Amazon Fire HD Tablet, I have always liked a reader with this type of screen when I read in a brightly lit area or out of doors. I was disappointed that my earlier reader did not last four years even though it was treated with tender loving care, but I am pleased with the performance of this replacement. Since my previous reader was out of warranty, Amazon only gave me a $10 credit towards the purchase of this replacement. Be that as it may, I do like the new reader very much. It is made entirely of plastic which makes it notably lighter than the earlier version, a definite plus. Also the screen on the new reader has a much better contrast between the letters and the background than the screen did on the earlier reader, again another definite plus. Another enhancement is that the new reader does away with the mechanical buttons that were on the older reader.  Thus, every command is made via a touch screen which I like much better.  With the older reader, one had to toughen the skin on one's thumbs to avoid the pain and numbness that accompanied uncalloused thumbs when turning pages with the old mechanical buttons. A final plus is that the sync and reference look-ups work much better on this reader because it has the improved touch screen features instead of the mechanical buttons.  In summary, I think this is a great reader for anyone who wants to read E-books in in brightly lighted area.  Personally, I find that I get much less eye fatigue with this reader  than I do with my Paper-white or my Kindle Fire HD. I particularly like the light weight of this reader. I find it is easy to hold for hours at a time without the need to use a stand.  The only criticism one might have for this particular reader over say a Kindle tablet, is that it does not display the books in color which is not an issue to me.  Needless to say, it also does not play music or display movies, but that is not why one would buy this type of reader. .",5

And reading outside was even worse!Within a few minutes of setting this little beauty up, I was reading happily, with no glare, no backlight issues and (this is the crunch) NO HEADACHE!Taking into consideration that this is supposed to be a replacement for a paperback book, it does it job admirably. No glare, easy to adjust fonts, great ability to look up words, acronyms and passages from books using the highlight tool when connected to wifi...just brilliant.Another great ""feature"" that I have just discovered, is that it's just the right size to fit in a jacket pocket, when I want to take this little beauty on a walk to a park to sit and read in a lunch hour. And reading out in broad daylight is an absolute dream.It's easy to set up, intuitive to use and does exactly what it's designed to do...and it does it exceptionally well.I'm sold. I don't have any prior experience with the Paperwhite, so can't compare the higher resolution of that model to the relatively low resolution of this model, but I think it's unfair to say that this screen is ""low resolution""...it's printed words and the odd illustration - not fine art. This is more than adequate for anyone who wants to read books, without physically lugging about a heap of paperbacks everywhere you go.I can also recommend the Amazon case for the Kindle (2016)  - I got one with my Kindle and it fits perfectly, doesn't add bulk and sleeps/wakes the Kindle on opening/closing the front flap - which is held closed by a magnetic closure on the edge.I simply have to recommend this product - I can't believe I waited this long to bite the bullet and get a Kindle.",5

This means you can store your kindle away, and pick up where you left off weeks later without having to charge your device, just like as if you were reading a real book.Does the kindle do anything else? Not really. It has a built in “experimental browser” but it’s really buggy and not worth using. Trust me. If I absolutely needed to look something up, and the Kindle was my only option, I really wouldn’t depend on it.

I received a Kindle as an early Christmas present this year.Reading from the Kindle is like reading from a book. There is no glare and the batteries are suppose to last a long time.I was a bit surprised and disappointed when I realized that the Kindle was black and white. I guess if you like color picture books, you need a tablet (I could not find this information on the product specs when I looked for it).The lack of a light is also disappointing as it means I can't read in bed when the lights are out. I guess my iPhone will still serve for reading in the dark. On the positive end, this makes the Kindle easier on the eyes when you are reading with external lights and it allows it to keep the batteries running longer. If you want the light, get a different model.This Kindle is like a collection of books, not a tablet or mini computer. If you want to surf Facebook or check email, this is the wrong devise for you. That's a shame as it means I have to move books from my email to my computer to my Kindle instead of directly from my email to my computer when I receive books in my email. It is also a drag as I have to use my phone or computer to leave reviews (though you can put up a star rating).Be sure you have a plug for your Kindle. It includes the cord you can plug into a USB port. I use the same wall plug as I use for my iPhone (just switch the cord), but I think it's cheap not to include one.One last complaint- I'm having a heck of a time finding page numbers on my book. I'm sure it is something simple, but I haven't had a chance ti figure it out yet.This is a cool devise for reading books and the price is reasonable, but know what you are getting. A tablet might be a better choice, but then again, this might be exactly what you want.Additional note: I got a Kindle Fire recently, so I can compare them now.

I use the public wifi at the library and when I turned on my reader it connected.  Now all is changed, and much more complicated. I know the dictionary is still there, but how to use it with my reading - no idea. I can sync to the library wifi, but it involves several steps. It downloads my new stuff, but takes a long time and then is hard to find in my lists. All I want to do is read on my reader, so I didn't think I needed fancy, but I'm wondering if a different would work better for me. I am very unhappy with my new reader.",2

I only notice it when sitting under an overhead light and even then I can adjust to where it's not disruptive.The size is really nice and fits in my hands well. It's also very thin which I like. It fits in my purse easily and weighs almost nothing.I haven't bought a case for it yet, but after a few months of reading it out on the train, bus, and other public areas where I have a spare moment, I realized a case may be useful in those situations.

So for a right handed person there is no easy way of holding this without accidentally hitting the power button with regularity.

I don't get ads - except the start-up screen.  I can deal with that.  I can't decide in the middle of a book that I'm bored and check my email or play words with friends on this reader - and that's a good thing as it keeps me focused and honest about if I really want to read or if I should be doing something else.

I pre-ordered the kindle and received it right away the day it came out. I've been using it every since and have a couple other kindles I compared it to. I'll put this up here. After spending money on an official amazon kindle case for this(and waiting 5 weeks for it to arrive), it costs as much as one of the more expensive, but ultimately more useful Paperwhites - [[ASIN:B00OQVZDJM Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - Black]The battery life, and that sweet sweet backlight is absolutely a necessity for me. I read my kindle roughly 5-6 days on the train, plus when I'm at home usually unwinding getting ready for bed. Even on the train when I didn't absolutely need a backlight I found myself using it at a very low setting on the kindle to just boost the screen a bit. At home I needed the backlight so I could read because I dimmed my lights to a low setting in the room. This alone makes the extra money on a paper white is absolutely. I really do appreciate Amazon slashing the entry level price, and I think the target here is for parents who want to get something very cheap for their kids, or students. Its genius for that market, so if you are a parent who has a few kids, and want to get them something that won't break the bank, but won't let them sit online and play games on their smart tablet, or fire device.Pros:Charges quickly via micro USB portPrice point to get a kindle is incredibleSame book storage size as the much more expensive kindles on the market(4 Gigabytes)Cons:No built in lightBattery life is a little less than I'd like, sometimes making it only 2 weeks before dyingCase feels cheap, not soft touch like the older kindles",3

I occasionally turn a page I didn't intend to turn, or activate one of the other functions unintentionally, but just touching the page again reverses that.

This doesn't come with a light, so I bought a snap on light that is great for reading late at night.

I read a good bit of science and math heavy books and the charts and graphs are displayed in minuscule font and cannot be enlarged like the regular text. It is sometimes impossible to read the chart titles and/or axis titles. The resolution is noticeably poor when displayed this type of information. Most textbooks have an eBook format that is only supported by Kindle Fire and similar tablets, so you cannot use this Kindle for most textbooks. For regular text in a novel, the resolution is fine. I had no issues getting eBooks from the local library sent to my Kindle, which I think is a great feature!This truly has no light, which is important to know getting into it. I've had difficulty reading in dimly lit rooms with this screen. I have also noticed quite a bit of glare at random times on the screen. Usually, if I tilt the screen slightly, this goes away. This isn't a problem for me, but it is important to consider when purchasing an eReader. The battery definitely doesn't last six weeks! I don't know if they tested it six weeks without use and that's how they got that stat, or if they use an average of one hour reading per day, per week?  My Kindle most definitely does not last that long. I would say 25 hours at the most on one charge. The WiFi connection has impressed me. I am always able to quickly connect to a WiFi network. The dictionary lookup feature is awesome! The touchscreen is pretty accurate. I've noticed I need more pressure for the highlighting, lookup functions, and less for the page turn. Once I figured that out, the touchscreen hasn't been problematic at all. Overall, a pleasant experience for me using this Kindle.UPDATE (6/25/2017): The battery life has declined considerably since I purchased it. I think the battery life is over estimated. I've talked to several other Kindle owners who had similar problems, so I don't believe that my kindle is defective.

Reading isn't hindered by the size because the font size is adjustable (and in a much easier way than the original Kindle touch).I personally don't find the brightness of the screen an issue.  I recognized and knew that I wasn't purchasing the Paperwhite so I didn't expect a light or a screen that would emulate such.  I think the screen is plenty clear especially in comparison to the first generation model of the Touch that I was replacing it with.  The matte screen still protects the screen from glare while reading in a well-lit area.The battery life, while still good (one week of light use has gotten me down to about half charge) lacks in comparison to the first generation that I could go weeks with on one charge.The only thing I have a slight issue with is the interface of this Kindle.  It's not entirely intuitive on how to access your books or to download them from the cloud or even switching between ""collection"" view and ""all books"" view.

I can see why so many people fall in love with their personal E-readers. For instance, if you are a college student leaving for college, the kindle is probably perfect for you. Light and portable so it doesn't take up space like real books and it has an absolutely wonderful battery life.In other words, the kindle is perfect for people who travel a lot or are currently living away from home.",5

On the plus side, the screen is very sensitive and responsive to touch.  However, the screen is very sensitive and responsive to touch.  It's easy to get it to do what you want, but it is also really easy to accidentally turn pages.  Also, the act of picking it up after I have set it down while reading almost inevitably causes it to bring up the font size selection and change to a larger font.  Honestly, I prefer the feel and operation of the older Kindle 4.  The touch screen is nice, but not that nice.  The interface used to be simpler and they used to have those lovely power connectors on the back that allowed a case that had a book light to be run off the kindle battery.  A streamlined design is not always desirable.",4

My only slight gripe is the battery, which claims more life-per-charge than I seem to be getting. Obviously this is no substitute for a decent iPad or even my iPhone, but then it never pretends to be.

The font is easily changeable and you can change which info you have displayed on the screen while you read (how much time left in chapter, how much time left in book, page number, location in book) which I love!

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Kimberly","I am an avid reader and, though I've used the Kindle app, I've always preferred actual books; I was't sure if I would like reading from a Kindle. But I absolutely love it! The sale price ($59.99) was very reasonable, making it worth the risk purchasing. I mainly wanted something that would be convenient for my commute--books are heavy to carry around. This Kindle is very lightweight and thin, making it easy to pack into a purse, even a small one. Now I can bring a book wherever I go in case I have a spare moment while I'm out and about. I love that it can hold multiple books so that if I finish one, I can easily start another.  I also love that I can download Kindle books from the public library. The battery did last quite a while--it lasted over a week of commuting to and from work, though I charged it before the battery drained completely. It charges quickly. The Kindle is perfect for traveling, whether for one's everyday commute, or for a longer trip.In regards to comfort of reading, the screen really does seem like real paper! It is also comfortable to hold and the ""pages"" are easy to turn. I had bought a case for it but ended up returning it, as I really like holding it as is (I plan to purchase a sleeve for it instead). I appreciate that one can change the font, size, and other aspects to adjust to one's reading preference. I know many people complained that they wish it had a light, but I actually like that it doesn't. This makes the Kindle more like a book and is probably better for one's eyes (as long as you read in a fairly well-lit area). It is great for reading outside--especially when it's windy! There are no pages to flutter around, which can be annoying when reading a regular book outside.Overall, I definitely do not regret this purchase. In terms of suggestions, I wish the Kindle were in color (rather than strictly black and white), and that the screen was a bit whiter rather than its gray tinge--this would make it more like a regular book. I also wish Amazon would create a sleeve for the Kindle, for those of us who want something to carry the Kindle in, but don't want the extra weight and discomfort of a case when reading.",5

This is very casual, cheap, compatible, light, and connect directly to your Amazon account. I do not regret this purchase and it comes in many colors ""In terms of the case"" and suits anyone's taste.

All in all, I am very satisfied.Not to say there arent negatives.  My generation 1 Kobo had a textured plastic back, which is far preferable to the smooth Kindle.  The Kindle requires WiFi to be enabled to use the dictionary feature.  This is idiotic, as there is a built in dictionary and no need for the WiFi to drain the battery.  However, that is how they update their ""special offers.""  Its annoying that the ""special offers"" are there, they only show up on the lock screen and a small ad at the bottom of non-reading pages.  Yes, I could pay $25 to remove them (screw that), but they arent that noticeable.  Heck, the pictures are designed for color displays, so half the time you cant see what they are anyway.  Obviously, the Kindle is Amazons proprietary eReader, so if you do not use Amazon's store, you need a third party program like Calibre to get books on it.

I am thrilled that, wherever I go, I have a whole library of options, in a thin, small little device.  However, I guess I was not attentive when ordering and got the version without a backlight (my fault) but wouldn't the backlight be a great feature for all kindles to have.  My real complaint is how hard it is to highlight text.  Up a line, down a line, too much, too little.  I just have given up entirely and now if i get more words than i wanted, I accept it and move on.  The font often end up readjusting itself from something I must be accidentally doing.  Again, I just deal with it.  The font is not adjustable for text in the strore, so if I want to read reviews and summaries I have switch to my laptop.  Again, if the backlight came standard, I think that would help when reading smaller fonts.  At first I was thinking the size seemed so small, but that I have grown to appreciate.

Gilmore","I ordered this during the Prime Day sale to replace an older Kindle 4 because the screen was broken due to an unfortunate run in with my 2 year old. It's about what I expected and it does everything that I need it to do, which is allow me to read e-books that I've purchased from Amazon or that I've checked out from the library. However, I think there are some notable cons to this device that I didn't face with my previous Kindle.Pros:- It's the newest version of Amazon's Kindle reader so I won't have to worry about support being dropped like I did with my Kindle 4.- It's faster than my older Kindle- It's light and the screen is easy to read- Compact with a comfortable form factor- Typing is easier on the touch screen than it was trying to navigate a keyboard with the physical arrow buttons.Cons- I miss the soft touch plastic on the back from my Kindle 4. It made it less slippery which to me, seemed easier to hold and less cheap feeling. This device is made of all plastic and the rounded edges can be slippery, making the device harder to hold than it previously was.- I didn't think it would be a big deal but I miss the page turning buttons on either side of the screen. It seems silly to me now to have a touch screen on an e-reader. It's not a very good or responsive touch screen which makes the actual use of it rather difficult in practice. And the screen is now prone to more fingerprints and damage from having to touch it all the time than it was previously when all of the buttons were analog. It's not a huge deal but it does make navigation of the actual device less intuitive. For instance, on my Kindle 4, I would push the power button to wake from sleep and the device was now on. With this Kindle, I push the power button, then I have to swipe the screen to get to wake up the device. It has essentially doubled the amount of actions I have to take in order to wake up the device. There are other things, like while reading I need to touch left or right of the page to turn the page but the top of the screen for bringing up the menu. The screen doesn't always read your touch properly so sometimes when you want the menu it will turn the page and vice versa.I know, first world problems but to me it's a step backwards in terms of user experience design. Overall, I know I'll get used to it's quirks but it's worth mentioning for those who are looking to upgrade from older models. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this version of the Kindle as it's main functions have stayed largely unchanged.TL;DR It's a decent upgrade with a few flaws that keep it from being my perfect device.",4

I read many reviews, both negative and positive, and I've gotta say I really love this device. I wanted something to download and read my purchased and borrowed books with, and that's exactly what I got. I didn't need another device to ""surf"" the web with, just get reading material. I don't need a lighted device because I never read in the dark. If you're looking for a great, not too big nor too small, very reasonably priced way to just read, this is it. I got a spiffy cover for it, just a little splurge for my birthday, but it's not really needed, just purty. Change your font, set your own print size and your ready to go. It's easy to set up, and has an initial one year warranty with additional coverage  available at an affordable price. I recommend this Kindle for all the aforementioned reasons, and for those of us on fixed incomes who don't really need extra ""bells and whistles"". Enjoy!",5

Sometimes the touch screen on the new unit does not respond at all, sometimes it doesn't respond as I want, and sometimes it seems to respond wildly to the least accidental contact, powering the unit on when I want to power it off or hiding my content behind strange menus.  With the old unit, the latest edition of my New York Times subscription downloaded automatically any time I turned the unit on. With the new unit, I have to power up the unit, try to get the task bar to appear (if the touch screen is responding), tap on the ""home"" icon, tap the New York Times icon, tap the  ""all"" and then, if I can find it, tap on the icon for the current edition.  Once the download is complete, the icon for the current edition moves to another location, and I must find it again.  With the old unit, other operations like deleting content were simple and intuitive; with the new unit I find I can't get through them without reference to the user's manual.  I realize that the new touch-screen unit may accommodate a lot of features not available on the old unit, but I didn't need them before, and i don't need them now.

There is less material around the screen, most noticeably at the bottom.  I linked my E-reader to my local library's digital system and have no problems getting books that way.

So you don't get any pop up notifications about emails or app updates. There are no distractions when reading.- There's no backlight. I love that the screen is like that of the original Kindles, meant to resemble a physical book. When reading, that backlight can irritate your eyes, causing headaches. For someone who is an avid reader like I am, and already had poor vision and migraine issues, it made reading painful after a while. The backlight on the Fire tablets are great for comic books and graphic novels, but not so much for reading regular books.- Smooth page transition. Just swipe the page left or right.- It's small and light weight. It fits in the palm of my hands and doesn't add much weight to my purse when I travel.My only real complaint is the on screen keyboard is a little difficult to use and the home screen can be confusing if you never owned an original kindle.

I wanted a Kindle exactly like the old one that I accidentally stepped on, cracking the screen, and thought I'd just get the newest version. I charged it the MINUTE it was delivered, I was so excited!Then, I turned it on, looked at the new Home screen, and said to myself ""WHAT IN THE HOLY BLUE HELL IS THIS?!?!?!"" The ""library"" link - the only section I care about - was a very, very small text list of books I'd purchased through Amazon, and only three of the ebooks I'd transferred to the main memory that I had purchased before I bought my first Kindle; mostly copies of older beloved books I own hard copies of that I like to re-read. There was NO way I could find to access a full list of the books in memory instead of the cloud. There may be a ""workaround"" out there on the internet, but I just want an e-reader, not a lesson in networking. Not only that, the three non-Amazon books weren't listed by text, but by cover art. Which this screen is WAAAAY too grey and small to really see them on. Got the one I wanted on the third try, though. ;/Maybe other people shop directly on their Kindle, or go to Goodreads or link to Facebook or something, but like I said; for me, the screen is too small and grey. It's not actually a hardship to put down my Kindle and open the laptop or tablet to shop and review. I have the Kindle app on all of my devices, so that I'm never without my books.After less than a day, I initiated a return. I hate this thing so damn much. I continued to read while the older Certified Refurbished Kindle, 6"" E Ink Display, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers (Previous Generation - 5th) that I ordered came, and I never started hating it less.

I like to lay on my side, and frequently switch sides. Not a problem with the old one, no need to switch anything in settings, just keep reading. On the touch screen, you have to tap the right side to go forward, and the left side to go back. I spent three days trying to do that one-handed, and only succeeded a couple of times while holding it in my right hand, and never while holding it in my left. Sometimes, when I was turning over my thumb would brush the screen, and the font size would be different or something else weird.

I loved that Kindle, mostly because I Hate touch screen products. Plus it was simple and mainly just for reading. That is the reason I wanted a Kindle in the first place. My second Kindle is a Fire that I got from my work for safety points I needed to cash in. I do not like the Fire version that I have. I use it sometimes but the battery life is just horrible compared to the regular reading Kindles.  Anyway, my Kindle Keyboard froze up on me and I couldn't fix it, so I had to buy another one. I chose this All New Kindle E-reader Black, 6"" version. I wanted a Kindle that was not touch but they don't make those anymore. This was the closest one I could find without all of the bells and whistles the Fire models have. When I first opened the box and took it out, I noticed that it seems to be very fragile. I know that it is an electronic device and should be handled with care but, this model feels very cheap, as far as the plastic around it is concerned. I intend on getting a case for it and I take very good care of the things I buy, so hopefully all will be good. The only problem I had was that my computer didn't recognize it at first. Which meant my library from the other Kindles were not present on the new one. I tried for hours but got nowhere. Then for no reason, the next evening I tried and it showed up. I think it was something I did wrong on my end though. Once up and running, I have been using it a lot without any issues. This model is smaller than my keyboard model but it doesn't bother me all that bad. The no glare screen is great, and the ink display is great. This model doesn't have a backlit screen (which I knew ahead of time), so be aware of that. It is wi-fi, and touch screen. Black and white display too so if you want to view magazines on your Kindle you better get a Fire. I only want to use mine for reading books so this doesn't bother me in the least. Battery life so far has been really good. I haven't charged it since I bought it a couple of weeks ago. The one thing that I wish it had (besides a keyboard), is page turn buttons on the side (like my keyboard model). Bottom line is that I bought this All New model for $49 new.

Tylor","As a college track athlete, a few months ago I purchased this Kindle after it had been on sale for a very good price (about $45) and I really needed something that would allow me to take my library around with me on trips and weekend competitions. I was getting tired of using my phone or computer to read books off of as I need the battery life for other things (especially homework on track trips).  First off, it is very solid in build quality although the touch screen will leave you wanting. I would recommend buying a case that can cover the screen as it easily gets scratched, even if it has its own pocket in your bag. However, it is rather easy to read in the light although if it gets too dark it is difficult due to the fact that it's not backlit (if you want backlit, you'll need to purchase the Kindle Paperwhite. The anti-glare screen does a decent job, although it certainly has a glare out in direct sunlight, though not as much of a glare as if you were using something like your iPhone or a different tablet like the Kindle Fire. One thing that this product does excel in is its battery life. I consistently get 2-3 weeks of use out of a single charge which was nice. I would recommend this product for anyone who needs a lightweight, easy solution to take their reading with them but if is lost isn't going to break the bank (so students especially). Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers",3
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Leah","I took the plunge with the Cyber Monday sale and got this Kindle for $50. My husband and I had both been reading a lot more frequently, especially when we were out for day trips or vacations, and as much as I love books, I realized that I needed a solution for my quickly dwindling book shelf and carry on bag space. I have a number of books on the Kindle app on my phone, but that screen can become quite small after a while, so a Kindle E-reader seemed like the best option. I have used it every day since it arrived and am quite pleased with it. There are so many free or very inexpensive ebooks on Amazon to thrill any book lover's heart and more than enough space on the Kindle for all I could want. It's a very user-friendly device and definitely light enough to hold in one hand and still use your thumb to turn pages; the screen is also a great size, and I've enjoyed the different font sizes I'm able to choose from. It is not backlit, so you cannot read it in the dark, but I understand that it's better for your eyes and your sleep patterns this way. I do not believe you can reverse the background to black with white text, but honestly that's not a big deal to me. The only slight challenge I have had with it is trying to make out the pictures and words on the small book cover icons, such as the ones displayed in the suggested reading area. I think the digital ink is so cool and fantastic for reading, but obviously it doesn't make for crisp, clear images (not to mention that it's in grayscale, not color), so sometimes it's a bit difficult to see what the icon is. The full size cover image on the books in the library is easy to see details on (sans color, of course); it's just the small icons that can be problematic. However, I didn't buy the e-reader to stare at pictures of book covers; I bought it to read the books inside. If I want to stare at the cover, I can always pull up an image online. Also, if I can't figure out what any of the small icon say, I can always click on them and get the full details on the next screen that comes up.So all in all, I am thrilled with my purchase and look forward to enjoying it for years to come.",5

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Amazon Customer","This will be a very personal review for me to give, but it's my pleasure to be able to express what this Kindle has done for me.I'm an avid reader. I also suffer from SLE. What people may fail to know/realize is that such diseases often strike in the hands first, as mine has.I've always preferred the experience (convenience, feel, smell...yes, smell) of books and have long resisted books presented upon devices.However, that's now changed. I began experiencing cramping and shaking of my hands while trying to handle books. I'm very particular about the treatment of my library which includes that I detest breaking of the spine. (People to whom I have loaned books have been known to be refused any future loans due to breaking the spine of one of my books!) As we all know, thick books in particular are usually bound fairly tight sometimes making the reading of them (without breaking the spine) something of a challenge. Perhaps it was more so for me.Awkward positions, using both hands, dropping, having to stop, difficulty reading due to shaking, not feeling comfortable reading in public due to embarrassment, etc. finally took enough toll that my one requested item for Christmas was this device.I couldn't be more satisfied & feel all the more a fool for not getting one sooner!What this Kindle will mean for your family member/friend who suffers from an autoimmune/osteoarthritic condition:*No more cramping fingers/hands*No more shaking hands (which result in embarrassment and drops)*No more awkward positions*No more having to utilize both hands just to read a bookWhat I also found enjoyable (for all):*Ease of use. Frankly, though it's provided, I didn't find it necessary to complete the manual in order to operate it. Yes, it's that easy.*Lightweight.*Easy on the eyes w/ variable settings on font size/style for those who so desire/need it*Well constructed.*FREE books! Oh yes, you heard me. In between being able to purchase your next book? Type in ""free"", and, at present, be treated to a selection of 80,000+ titles! The genres offered run the gamut, and you will be able to find something (rather, several ""somethings"") that will tide you over nicely.In short, I couldn't be more satisfied, and I do thank you, Amazon, for offering this beneficial device.",5
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","JW. Healy","My Kindle Touch died after 4 yrs. I liked it a lot and so bought the new Kindle E-reader. I like it more. The screen is the same size as the Touch but the case is smaller and makes the reader easier to hold. The optional protective cover is thin, folds over flat and the cloth interior on the front cover helps keep the reader from sliding off your lap. The screen is even better then the one on the Touch.My only quibble is that the library shows a picture of the cover of the book which takes up a lot of screen real estate and can be hard to read. Since these books have no real cover I would prefer a simple listing of the book title and author together with an indicator of the amount read like they had on the Touch. It would be much easier to read and take up less space so more books could be displayed on a single page.",5

I find my hand.finger bumping into it from time to time. Also when im reading when laying back, the button is pressed against my stomach/belt.- The bottom of the kindle has extra space, i assume for holding. I find holding it pinched in my hand at the bottom feels awkward. I think it makes more sense to not make the bottom as big and add just a tiny bit more room on the sides. This might allow for larger screen size or saving cost on material.-No idea how the on button is supposed to work. I hold for a while to turn it on. and then when the screen is in hibernate I'd expect a light tap of the button or swipe against the screen for it to go back to my back. I guess you have to hold it again which turns the screen back on but brings me back to the options of turning off my screen and i feel it shouldnt do that.-I think the UX can be improved a bit in terms of how your books are presented/navigating between them and their notes/highlights- Highlighting is a bit jumpy.- Would be cool if there were reading stats. How long does it take me to read a page. is my reading speed improving. How long does it take for me to finish books. Can their be a tool to help me learn to read faster?- Generated vocab list. Click on certain words you come across that you don't know to add them to your own personal dictionary to help improve your vocab.(not sure if these things exist already, but if they do it would have been nice if they were pointed out)Overall I love this thing. nice job amazon!",4

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","alanhouston","The new 2016 Kindle E-Reader 8th generation is a very thin, very light way to read books.  Just books.  No e-mail.  No Netflix.  No music on Spotify.  Just books.And, that is why I enjoy it.  I can carry around fifty or sixty of my favorite books and not be distracted by all of the temptations offered by the Kindle Fire tablet.  I can adjust the font to a size that works for my aging eyes.  The screen works well outdoors.  Inside, you need good light, just as with  real books.It has a crisp image that is easy on the eyes without the glare and reflections of a color tablet.  You can chose the font density and size that works best for you.It is very light, much lighter than even a thin hard cover book.  I have dropped mine several times onto beds, sofas and carpet without damage. Hard wood or tile floor?  A good case might be helpful. Be sure the case is designed for the Kindle 8th generation.It can be buggy so when you turn it on it may choose a huge font or it can get ""stuck"" on the last page of a book, refusing to return to your home page. It might go into page preview mode when you tap to go forward to the next page or opens the dictionary by mistake.The dictionary is helpful.  I am too lazy to use a real dictionary but the Kindle dictionary opens instantly when you press on a word so I can quickly find out I've been misusing a word for sixty years.Battery life is very good, perhaps 20 or 30 hours of reading per charge.  It will charge with any usb charger and uses the same cable used by most Samsung phones.  So, no need to bring a second charger on trips.BUT....the price varies wildly week to week.  Sometimes it is priced almost as high as the fancy premium e-reader with its built in light for reading at night.  When the Kindle 8 is on sale  $50 or less, it is a very good investment.",4

Panic! I literally waited for 2 years after my last kindle broke because they didn't offer the keyboard anymore and went back to reading weighty space occupying books.  I'm definitely a keyboard person but was pleasantly pleased with the ease of use of this kindle. It was easy to use and the advertisements are not an issue at all and only appear when you first turn it on and if I'm not interested I just click no thanks.  This kindle is a lot smaller than I am use to but now I love that feature because it fits in any bag or purse I would like to put it in so I am never without.  It keeps excellent charge! My first one without 4G but not an issue. WiFi is everywhere these days and I download enough books when I am home that I don't see it being an issue as well.  I love that kindles do not strain your eyes.  I have enough eye problems and I'm constantly looking at a computer screen for work. I love that I don't have those lights straining my eyes for my joy reading.  It makes reading relaxing and I can read exceedingly longer because of this feature or lack of feature. The four stars is only because sometimes I hit the screen on accident and it jumps up a page or two which in and of itself is user error, however, when I try to go back to my page I was on it takes me everywhere! It cycles through the same 3-4 pages and never back to the spot I was reading on. Thus I have to pay attention to the chapter I'm on and go back to the table of contents page to get back to the page I was on.  Now that I could live without and it takes too much time but definitely not a deal breaker.  I love my Kindle once again!",4

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Kristle","Between my mom and I, we've owned and worn out six Kindles dating back to a much beloved Kindle keyboard. We're readers, not tv'ers. When my mom's Kindle fifth generation died, replacing it with the latest Kindle seemed like a no brainer. Then I opened the box.I code apps for a living. I'm tech savvy and rarely encounter any piece of tech I don't like at least a little. The only good points about this Kindle are its battery life and weight. During the setup, the keyboard lagged in comparison to the old Kindle fifth generation. Unexpected, but I wrote it out as an e-ink touchscreen quirk and kept going. Mistake!A good E-reader gets out of the way and lets me read. This doesn't! The OS automatically enables definitions and a slew of other social reading features all designed to get between the reader and their enjoyment of a good book. While your can turn these features off, they are ridiculously easy to accidentally turn on while you're reading. The pre-enabled definitions may be good for kids, but for adults... Look, I'm not five and haven't been for a long time. I do not need island defined, pronounced, etc.Swiping and tapping the screen does not always change the page. This is partially a sensitivity, cursor speed issue. Although this setting is standard on every other touchscreen OS, it does not exist here.As several reviewers have already noted, swiping to wake the screen frequently turns the page in whatever book you're reading and the font settings are so readily accessed, changing the font size at every page turn is not uncommon. It's annoying.Now back to those page turns... Do you like to eat and read? There's no page turn button so be ready for greasy fingerprints on your screen. Bathtub reading via the Amazon founder recommended Ziploc method is impossible.Recent changes to the Amazon store also make freebies difficult to find. We read about 30-40-30 mix around here (freebies, library, purchase). Losing easy access to the thirty from the Kindle itself...ouch!In conclusion, when the remaining fifth gen died a few weeks ago, we bought a 7 inch Samsung galaxy tab a, installed the Kindle app, and changed the settings to allow page turns via the volume buttons. It's a little heavier. The battery won't last for weeks, but does it really need to? Probably not. With battery saver on and wifi on, we're getting twenty one hours usage time. Turning off wifi would improve that. A matte screen protector fixed the glare issue. A hack yes, but as least we have a page turn button back and we've yet to change the font accidentally or turn a page while waking the device. While the e-ink screen will be missed, the reading experience won't.",2

My husband had bought me a kindle fire- beautiful color but doesn't work like the kindle paperwhite as far as reading goes.

I'm sure that the higher end models are amazing, but for me, the reason behind wanting the basic model was to minimize any sorts of distractions.I had a tablet in the past and even though I could read on my tablet, there were just so many distractions, that I could not. With Kindle, that problem has gone away and I really like that and am glad to be engrossed in reading after a break.For someone who has never had an e-reader, I'll definitely suggest this product since it doesn't break the bank and does what it's supposed to do really well.

Had some very small signs of wear but I had bought mine used and it is going to be used for reading anyway so I'm not picky on that. Very lightweight. At first, I wanted the dimensions of the kindle to be taller but the text size is adjustable and I think I wanted it that way being so accustomed to hard copy books. Kindle arrived on time as notified by my text alerts and was sent by Amazon's shipping (not UPS or any other carrier). The kindle never really turns off unless the battery is dead but as stated, it doesn't need to be charged often. I haven't kept track of how many weeks I go without charging it. There is only one button which is the lock/unlock that you need to hold down just a tad bit as it doesn't unlock as quickly as a phone would--which makes sense because once you ""unlock"" it, you have to swipe the screen and the delay prevents you from making immediate purchases from the screensaver/ads. The way the color format (or lack thereof) will definitely trip you out and those who have never used a kindle but it makes it easy on the eyes compared to the blue light from a phone or a computer monitor. That being said, it isn't like the other kindles and you would require adequate lighting to read with it. Overall, I think that it is a wonderful investment for casual and avid book readers who although love the feel of a book, will make the investment for this because it saves you money in the long run, is lightweight, easily transportable, you can take notes and highlight, and has a long battery life.",5

Inexplicably, the screen developed horizontal and vertical lines that are irreparable, despite the fact that it was gently used and not dropped or damaged that I am aware of. I didn't use it often unless I was traveling, so it looks like new. Amazon was very helpful in giving me a good deal on this new one, but it's not comparable to what I had. Yes, it's cheaper, but it doesn't include a charger plug, case, keyboard, or page buttons like my 2nd generation did. But my main issue is that it is too small, flimsy and the touch screen is inferior to the page and toggle buttons of my 2nd generation Kindle. Reading is a hassle because my fingers keep accidentally touching the screen and causing wrong pages and other pop-ups to come up. And the touch screen icons and keyboard letters are tiny, which needs a stylus even for thin fingers like mine. In addition the screen is gray and hard to read even when text is enlarged. And the ads are annoying! Not fair that you have to pay more to get an ad-free Kindle.I wish there were some way to repair my 2nd generation Kindle, which is much easier to hold and navigate...and the page buttons and toggle make page turning and selections deliberate instead of accidental. I am very disappointed. Reading my new Kindle is annoying and unpleasant. I'd rather read a book.

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Candi","I enjoy my Kindle e-reader. I started with this entry-level 8th generation option to explore whether I'd actually like and utilize an e-reader versus the iPad I already own.PROS:- Size and Convenience: I have small hands and this little compact and super light e-reader can be held comfortably, with little to no fuss. It doesn't add any noticeable weight to my bag, which makes it super convenient to carry around each day. Please note that the surface is rather smooth, which is why I also purchased the Kindle case to give me a better grip.(Kindle, 8th gen.: size: 6.3 x 4.5 x 0.4; weight: 5.76 oz) (iPad Air 2: size: 9.4 x 6.6 x 0.24 ; weight: .96 lb)- Anti-Glare Screen: Unlike my iPad, I can read my Kindle in the great outdoors. In sunlight the words are crisp and clear; it's like reading the page of a book. (I have noticed a slight light reflection on my Kindle when in certain lighting, but it's pales in comparison to the natural light interference experienced with the iPad.)- No Backlight: This model does not have a light! Again, there's NO LIGHT. I purchased this reader for this very reason. The lights of my computer and iPad bother me after constant use. And if I have a headache, I'm even more sensitive to the lights of my devices.CONS:- Touchscreen: While I like touching the screen to turn pages, the screen is rather sensitive. If my scarf brushes it, the pages will turn. If I carry it without the cover closed, I undoubtedly will look down and have lost my spot. This isn't a deal breaker, but it is annoying.- Replacement Within First Week: I'm on my second Kindle device, as my first one started freezing and hard resetting within the very first day. I nicked 1 point off of my rating for this. I initially thought it was my error, but it happened so many times over my vacation that I knew it was a faulty device. Kindle Customer Service ultimately replaced the device and I haven't had further issues, but it took a few reps trying the same tests and planning to call me back before they finally issued a replacement.Overall, I purchased this for reading so I wasn't expecting the bells and whistles - games, Internet browsing, checking emails, videos, etc. - of my tablet. There is an experimental browser on the device, but it is rather rudimentary. If you're looking for gaming, browsing, email or any additional features beyond good old fashion reading, then this 8th generation Kindle isn't for you. It's an entry-level e-reader at a very modest price point - an even better price point if you can catch a sale. It's light, convenient and a rather great replacement to carrying around a heavier book or my iPad each day.",4

I don't always like looking up how to use something on line. But we are in that day and age which is rather scary to me, if you are going to put in a piece of paper to tell people how to turn on the thing then you can add a line about how to find the user manual.This is little kindle is great for reading, actually less weighted than my normal ""real"" paper backs it's a God send to me since I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and this little lightweight kindle is easy to hold, but not always so easy to maneuver which brings me to four stars instead of five. Once I have looked at the manual and still can't get my library to come up on wi-fi there is a real issue with that.I have struggled and struggled to figure out how to get the menu to come up when I need it not when it feels like changing the font size all by itself. I find this most annoying. I have my kindle set the size I want it and sometimes when reading my little kindle will change font without me touching the dashboard to assist in changing that setting. It's very strange at times.I like that It doesn't have a back light because it makes me put it down when I am tired instead of fighting through the sleepiness to read more.I have issue with the fact that this particular kindle doesn't seem to want to stay on the settings I have placed it on and they change randomly. I have friends with kindles and none of them do this, the things that I experience with this kindle are unreal but sort of fun, I never know what's going to happen next. I do recommend getting this type of kindle and allowing yourself to go to sleep when you are reading as though you are holding a regular paperback book. Instead of getting the one with the back light that keeps you from going to sleep because of the back lit story line.I really like this kindle and highly recommend it if you want your entire digital collection in the same place.",4

In the last month or so since I've had it, I've read 3 and a half books! I'm working my way through the 4th book and am trying to get an early start on jumping back into old reading habits. This little kindle has been a godsend for that. It's worth every penny!I do wish you could have your collections sync a little better in the cloud. For example, the collections or folders input together sync decently however all the books are out of order. SO if I have a series I'm reading that has 15+ books, it's not easy to tell which one comes first. Yet in the kindle app for iPad, you can manually order the books. When are you going to make it sync exactly the same across all devices amazon?!This device gets 5/5 stars from me, despite its minor flaw. Beware, while it syncs to the furthest page read, the feature where the words are highlighted as the audiobook goes along is NOT available. My household is quickly becoming an Amazon House hold and I would love love love to have my Alexa read to me while the words are highlighted on the book itself. Either way, this device is perfect.

There's really nothing to hold on to and of course with the new touch screen, I can't let my thumbs extend past the edges for fear of accidentally turning the page or highlighting something.  I much prefer the page turning buttons on the previous models.  Also, the awkward ways I end up holding the device leave my hands feeling tired and cramped.

In full daylight or a well-lit room, this device is perfectly adequate for reading your ebooks, browsing the kindle store, and updating goodreads; however, if you have a room that is not so well lit, it is a significant drawback compared to the other kindle models that have built in lighting functionality.This new Baseline Kindle is a very lightweight and portable e-reader. It fits easily into your jeans pocket or purse.My biggest issue with this device is that it's actually really slippery in your hand. I would recommend getting a case for the Kindle that will help you to better grip and hold the device.I personally did not get to test the Bluetooth functionality for the audio capabilities of this device however I have listened to the Amazon Robo reader on another Kindle device and it is great functionality for those are blind or cannot read text; however, I don't think it is very practical for any other use than that. Listening to the Robo reader read the book is like listening to a special weather announcement but for an extended period of time.To summarize let's not forget that 3 stars means it's a good device I believe that the basic Kindle is exactly that a good e-reader. How slippery the device is should not be underestimated, it really negatively affected my experience with this device. The texture of the casing also just feels cheap. The resolution of the text is also a noticeable difference  it's fine as a basic eReader however compared to the other Kindles it is noticeable.

I was upset, because I loved my old kindle- it had no distractions of email or social media.  However, I have had this one for 3 weeks now, and this one delivers!!!  I paid a little more for the one without special offers.  It is NOT DARK like other reviews say- yeah, you can't read in the dark, but I can read next to my lamp at night just as well as I could with my old one.  The size is smaller and lighter than my old one, which actually took a couple of weeks to get used to.  I think I just got used to holding my old kindle by the buttons on the sides after all these years.  Now I am comfortable with it. It was easy to understand the new features, and I LOVE the vocabulary builder.  If you touch a word to look it up in the dictionary, it remembers the words, and you can look at the list again to learn new vocabulary.  I turned it on airplane mode to save battery life and I just recently had to charge the battery- I say the battery lasts 1-2 weeks at least, depending on how much you read, of course.

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","strungoutbeadyeyes","This is my first Kindle but I've seen my friend's older versions. Not only is it smaller (same screen size) and lighter, but there are no buttons, only touch-screen, which is VERY sensitive, so I definitely went through the tutorial. Sometimes when you want to turn the page, it's easy to touch a footnote or some other link, but that's the acceptable trade-off of with the convenience it offers.Since this is my first e-book, the main adaptation is sensory, and it involves shedding the ""feel"" of pages in a traditional book. What I also didn't know about is that Kindle comes with a built-in advertising feature, so whenever you open it, you are subject to to a Kindle book promotion. I was soon getting annoyed with this. I paid for the e-reader just like any other electronic device, and then you pay for the e-books you buy, so why should Amazon have the right to continue bombarding me with their promotional material? I looked into this and that is the ""deal"" when you buy a Kindle, but for $20, you can remove this feature in your settings. So my Kindle ended up costing that much more. If this doesn't bother you, more power to you, but I was not impressed. I'll eventually get over this irritation, but that's really the main reason I'm withholding a 5-star rating.",4
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","S. L.","I really am enjoying this version of the Kindle e-reader. I have been buying these products since the Kindle Keyboard, and the quality of the products just keeps me coming back. This version is no exception. This 8th Generation Kindle e-reader is a basic e-reader: no backlight, but it has a very responsive touch screen. The set-up was a breeze (perhaps in part because I have done this process several times before, but I think even for someone new to the product, it would be pretty easy), and because I had books already in my library, it automatically found those books and I was able to start downloading the ones I wanted right away.I think my favorite thing about this version of the Kindle is that when you go to change your font size, the little window with the font options stays up. It doesn't go away right away after selecting a size as it did in previous versions I have had. I really like this for two reasons: 1) I often accidentally pull up the font size option, and after it changes it, want to change it back to what I'd had before. Because it doesn't close the window, I'm able to just make the fix and go on my way. 2) I sometimes make the wrong selection when trying to purposely change the size of the font, so being able to keep the window open until I'm sure I did it correctly is wonderful.I find it wonderful to read on this e-reader. I even read in the dark - I just attach a reading light to the top of my case so that I can read at night in bed. But this e-reader turns the pages smoothly, has crisp text, and has lots of options, including Word Wise, which is an option my daughter really likes. Word Wise allows a short definition of more difficult words to pop up above the word so that you don't have to spend the time to select each word.The only thing that makes me give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that when I am trying to turn BACK a page, I often end up turning FORWARD, even though I am pressing way over to the left of the screen. This is much more of a battle than I think it should be, but all-in-all is my only complaint with this device. I am really happy with this e-reader and would recommend it for new and seasoned readers alike.",4
"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Megan Cunnington","This is a newer Kindle to me, as I have been reading on the second generation one for the last several years. However, I decided to upgrade from the older one, mainly due to the clunky keyboard. I can't compare to very recent models of the Kindle, so I'll only compare to what I know. Overall, I like this Kindle. It's easy to use, functions well, and serves its purpose.The touch screen works well. The model I had was the old one with a very bad keyboard at the bottom. The buttons didn't always register a click, and it was like navigating a 1980s computer program. The screen is sensitive enough to touch that it registers my commands. The typing is similar to a smart phone, although not quite as effective. This is still clearly an e-reader, not a smart phone or tablet, so the touch screen on my iPhone works better. However, I wasn't expecting smart phone level commands on a small e-reader. It's not quite as sleek, but I haven't had any issues.The Kindle itself is smaller and lighter than my old version. I didn't think the old one was heavy, but what a difference a few years make! I think the screen might be higher resolution, but I'm not very good with technology, so I don't know the difference. If it's dramatically better, I couldn't tell you. I mainly bought this e-reader for the touch screen capabilities.This gets 4 instead of 5 stars due to the layout once the device is turned on. It automatically defaults to the kindle store instead of to your personal library. I haven't found a setting for this (I'll keep looking), but this may just be a personal preference. I liked it defaulting to my library, so that I only went to the store when purchasing a book. I spent 98% of my time with this device reading, so it makes more sense to default to what the device is actually used for. Additionally, this means that wifi is always on, using up battery. I preferred when I could keep wifi off most of the time. It's not a big deal, but it's a little tweak that would take this Kindle from good to great.Overall, this Kindle functions much better than the older model I had. I bought the previous one before I even had a smart phone, so I had no idea what I was missing in terms of functionality until I switched. In terms of actual reading, it works very well. My issues with it are very nit-picky preferences that don't impact how you use it 98% of what you're spending your time using it for. I wish collections showed the image of the first book in the collection instead of a file folder (as I think it's just prettier, but that's no big deal). While I preferred the aesthetic and viewing of the older model, this current version functions well enough that I prefer it.The only other issue I have has nothing to do with the Kindle itself. So far, I've only been able to find two cases, one for $15 that comes in black, and 4 colors that cost $25. This device has been out for a few months, but the case options are severely lacking. I never care about the color of devices as I can customize with the protection. However, I'll be waiting in order to find something that looks nice. When I search for cases for the Kindle, only two results have been for this case. The rest of the results are for older versions or the Paperwhite model. This is frustrating not being able to find a good case on Amazon's website. I specifically searched for 8th generation and most results say 'not for 8th generation.'Update: I have found a few cases in more color options for a better price. More seemed to pop up in the last week or so. May have been availability or browsing, I am not sure.",4

Unless you are really uncoordinated you can read and turn the page (swipe) with one hand.  The device is small but the screen is the same size as our Nook.  My only tip--wait until it goes on sale again.Update:  after using the e-reader for a while it has a big disadvantage versus the Nook. It is not easy to find and get to specific content.  For example, I downloaded a cookbook and trying to get to a certain recipe is impossible.  I have to pull it up on my ipad in order to get to the details.

I have 2 Amazon Fire tablets I bought for my wife and a Fire TV box for the main TV in the living room that the whole family uses and we've been happy with those products so I figured a Kindle was a solid choice for an e-reader. I thought I'd start with the entry level model since it was the cheapest in case I didn't like the screen size which is what I was most concerned about after using an ipad for so long. I knew going into it that there was no way to adjust the screen brightness and it was going to be darker that I was used to but I normally read in a pretty well lit room anyway and rarely in the dark so I took the plunge despite the number of low reviews and bought one. It arrived a couple of days later and I took out and fired it up, right from the start the device was quick and responsive and I've had no technical issues so far. I actually like the screen size better than I thought I would and for me personally I don't think it's too dark, sure, I wish it was a couple of shades lighter but it's not enough to keep from using it or bother me while reading a book on it. If you read this like a normal paper book in a well lit room you shouldn't have any issues with the dark screen but that's different for each person, my wife didn't think it was too dark either provided the lighting is good. My suggestion is if you live near a Best Buy to go check each model out and decide for yourself if you're that unsure, I was going to do that but after watching the video review by Phil (not) in Magnolia I decided that was very helpful and made my decision to go ahead and get one. If you know ahead of time you read in a low light setting or in bed at night with the lights out then buy the paper white model instead. I may still end up with a paper white or a voyage and give this one to one of my kids but for now I'm really pleased with it and haven't had any negative experiences with it yet.",5

I don't know why some have complained about the ease of page turning; the transition seems smooth to me. It would be nice to browse for books in color or from a more enhanced web browser. And I cannot see book ratings as readily from Goodreads on the device. But otherwise, I love my Kindle. It's my first e reader! It took some getting used to, but I love that I now have thousands of books conveniently at my fingertips.",4

Had (and still have) 2nd gen machine I love, but it getting old and slow with shorter battery life.  New machine has a number of good points.  Battery life, excellent, size small and great feel, screen size the same as my 2008.  The touch screen is good, bad and ugly.  Swiping seems easy after 5 months, it still isn't.  I keep touching and change font size, have trouble touching to get commands I want, setting bookmarks I do not need, and changing the settings I do not want to change.The setup to go to Amazon books and Goodreads is good.  I do not like the screens as much as the 2008 version.  But I can get around and use about half the time.  (I use 2008 for a lot of just plain browsing.)  Connectiveity seems better and faster.Biggest single fault is the loss of the next page previous page button.  The buttons gave me sure and certain positive one handed control.  The swipe to read has a number issues, including having to frequently using two hands, finger not always working and having swipe several time, inadvertently touching, and leaping ahead or back several pages.",2

I'm happy with how it works and it meets my expectations. That said, I should outline what those expectations were in order to be more informative. I wanted a Kindle for two main reasons: it has a bigger screen than my phone does and it doesn't have a backlight. My lifestyle of staring at my tiny iphone screen for hours on end, usually in the dark, is probably not good for me, so I've had my eye on the Kindle as a better alternative for a while. Having documents and books on the kindle pushes me to read with the light on in the room, which is exactly what I wanted, and the capability to change the font size is also an advantage. For these reasons, I'm happy with my purchase.The criticism I saw the most when I read reviews for this Kindle was that the screen is too dark. I don't find that a problem for myself. I wouldn't say that it's dark; rather, it isn't bleach-white. It's not white as a sheet, but not as dark as the yellowish hue of an old paperback novel. For me, it's neither a strain nor a setback. I was curious whether the ""special offers"" would be a hindrance but they aren't; they only show up as a screensaver when you aren't reading and aren't distracting on the home screen. Otherwise, they are not visible when you're reading.If you read the item specifications, there should be no surprises about size, (lack of) backlight, or functionality.",5

The device is light and easy to hold in one hand, with wonderful contrast, although there is a slight reflectiveness to the display. Its battery lasts for weeks of light use. The only final critique I have of the device is that if your university uses a very particular enterprise wifi configuration (TTLS-PAP) you will have difficulty connecting to your wifi.

This one is pretty good - touch works well (almost too well - I'm constantly changing fonts by accident). One star off since it is soo very easy to turn off. The button is on the bottom, right where my hand can hit it easily, and one bump turns it off. Very nice otherwise.UPDATE: having used this kindle for a while now, I've decided to downgrade to 2 stars. That button on the bottom - soooo easy to push, and I accidentally change font size every time I put the thing down. Seriously. I am truly gifted at messing with the size - even my dog walked by the other day and changed the font size with her paw (she gets jealous when I read). I hold this kindle near the bottom, and in a reading session, I probably accidentally turn it off about 3 times by brushing up against the power button. A sensitive button like this would do better at the top of the kindle where I wouldn't hit it so often. In fact, I'm switching back to my older non-touch screen today and retiring this one to the shelf. My older one has a power button at the bottom also, but it seems to be inset more than the button on this one. I have to make an effort to turn it off.",2

I also am not impressed by the advertisements on my lock screen, nor by the inability to turn them off. But most of all I am thoroughly disgusted with the fact that the samples are a lie.

Instead, samples appear in my content list on the website, but never on my Kindle. I can't read them at all. I attempted to download three different samples.

Unfortunately for those who actually uses this Kindle to read and store their books what sounds good doesn't work so well.The first buzz word they implemented is touch-screen. Sounds all high tech. But what it means is that if you are reading and want to go to another room you have to power down the Kindle or else by the time you have carried it to the other room the touch-screen has been touched so much you spend a good bit of time trying to get back to the page you were on. Same problem if your cat jumps up on you and you need to put the book down in a hurry to get the claws out of your chest. Keeping my hand from touching the screen is not my first concern when I have claws in my chest.The second buzz word is graphics. Again sounds all high tech. But what it means is that instead of seeing a list of your collections and books when you turn on the Kindle you see a bunch of hazy squares. If you look closely those squares are graphic representations in black and white of book covers. If you have a magnifying glass handy you can, at times, actually read the titles on those books. Luckily that is not your list of books. Rather there are three sections and one is your library. If you find the words ""My Library"" you can touch it and then actually get to where you want to be and would actually start on the older kindle. Thank goodness this kindle still starts on the last page you were reading if you have a book in process so while you have a book you are reading the whole graphics thing is a non-issue.In short, this Kindle was designed by marketing guys who never learned to read let alone ever used a Kindle.",2

It meets my expectations in every way except for a couple.  The housing is so narrow on three sides, that I am forever changing pages without intent.  Further it typically changes two pages before I'm able to jerk my hand off the page.  Depending on which hand, I then have to go back or forward two pages.  The good news is that that is a fast operation.  Also, in all the ads, Amazon says the battery will last for weeks with no qualifications.  I've had to recharge twice in the 10 days that I've had it.  I faithfully turn off the screen when I'm done, so I don't know how else to save battery power.  And it doesn't last as long as my old kindle did.  I'm slightly disappointed in those two things.  Otherwise I love the weight (very light) and wish I had a case for it (too expensive).

I loved it, but quickly it ran out of memory.  I bought this thinking it would hold a lot of books - which it does.  Plus I thought I would be able to read without my glasses as father time has definitely impacted my near sight.  I do like it, but honestly, I prefer the I pad.  The kindle is small and in order to increase the font in the books, I have to constantly swipe as there just isn't as much that can fit on the page.  Also, the screen off button is ridiculously difficult to get to appear.  You are supposed to hold the button for 7 seconds, but I have to do it like ten times before it works.  But my biggest gripe is the font.  You can only increase the font inside a book.  So I still need glasses to see what book I'm actually choosing.  In order to select a book, I log onto my PC and read about the books then memorize the title, put on my glasses and select it on the kindle.  After that I'm all set, but how annoying is that?

However, I find the touch screen to be be too sensitive.  It seems like I am constantly brushing and causing page changes.  Also, it is very lightweight and I think it is difficult to hold securely without touching the screen because the margins of the case are very narrow.  So for me,  I prefer my old Kindle 2 because it has more case to hold. I think clicking the page buttons on either side of my old Kindle is more convenient for me.The primary reason I purchased a new kindle is because I can download library books directly to it via WIFI.  The kindle 2 can't do that, so I have to download library books to my computer then transfer them to via USB.The short summary is that I love the screen/type  on the new kindle, but don't like the 'feel' of it .PS  I also purchased a Swees case cover at the same time.

The reader does not come on as quickly as my old reader did and it seems to take much longer to turn off. I'm sure I will eventually get used to it, but even after a couple of weeks I am quite frustrated with that little button.

Plus it integrates with Good Reads, so updating my progress is easy and I can quickly purchase the next book straight from my ""Want to Read"" queue. Brilliant!Worth noting, I have an astigmatism and have had headaches from eBooks in the past. My previous eBook was a Kindle Fire HD, which was a little thicker and was backlit. I much prefer the glare-free screen of my new Kindle. I haven't had any headaches, and the ""thinness"" of it is nice. I have the Amazon Kindle cover to go with it and I just love using it on the go.Plus, I'm reading now more than before. Maybe it's because the eBook is beautifully designed and is nice to look at, maybe it's because it has a slick Good Reads integration. I adore the 1-click feature.I highly recommend this product if you want to read more and have struggled with eye strain in the past!",5

I have never owned a E-book reader or any other device with a touch screen before. So it is a new experience and some things will take getting use to. However I must say the operation of the device is clunky. It is difficult to bring up the menu and even to flip pages since the screen does not always respond to a touch. Once you do get the menu options to display they are very small and hard to pick out from the closely set other commands. The keyboard is particularly hard to select individual items on it. Not to mention some of the things displayed like page numbers is incredibly small!Amazon might consider better functionality for those that do not have as good as tactile skills such as handicapped or older people.After one day of ownership I am not overwhelmed by this Kindle.

One issue is device specific and that is that title graphics are largely unreadable in icon sized black & white.Despite some difficulties, the device works well in decent lighting.

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Ronald Vick","This is my second Kindle.  My first finally gave up the ghost and frankly, I wanted a new one.  I had such good luck with the first, there was no question about getting the new model.  The advertising on this one seems a little confused about screen lighting, seems to indicate that this model has it, but it does not!  You still need external light.  On to my review-  The power up sequence seems a little strange... holding the power button seven seconds gets you to the possible re-boot.  Sometime a quick blip of the power switch gets you a 'Swipe to open' command, but sometimes it doesn't.  I haven't found the correct amount of time to be consistent.  It's a touch screen and there seems to be some problems in that area.  One-the fonts and command areas are fixed, which makes it difficult for me. (I have progressive myopia- the older I get the less I can see due to optic nerve damage.  To see what the command screen shows I have to use a magnifying glass on it.  Once I'm reading a book, I can change the font size to a comfortable size.)  By the way, the instructions on the web site always tell you to ""Tap the Screen."".  They don't tell where or what to tap, and it makes a difference.  I wish Amazon had included a 'Quick Start' guide with baby step instructions to get me going, rather than all the fumbling around I did to get up.  The tap screen has a Gotcha!  I hold the unit in my left hand, and when I tap with my right index finger, I find that my left thumb seems to be activating a 'Null' that does nothing but prevents the tap to advance to the next page.  I haven't found a way to advance the page in the My Library listing, except by a rather clumsy tap of the page number, which brings up a sub menu and numerical keyboard, where you enter the page or 'Titles starting with' and a Go button. I keep looking for a shortcut place to tap to just advance to the next page of the library.  I would also like a way to edit the meta data, because I occasionally download from site that don't use the exact Kindle method of saving authors, titles and info, so that I can put these items in order in the Library list.  It is annoying to have author names in place of the book name.  OK, enough bricks- the new Kindle is lighter and smaller.  I think the battery life is about the same as my first, if I turn the wi-fi off. (difficult to get a feeling for that)  Love the different font styles.  If I were buying again, I think I'd pay the extra to NOT have the advertising.  Overall, I like it.",4

It's comparable to the Nook Glow Light reader in set up and operation, also in how often it needs to be charged.  The idea of ""weeks"" of reading works only, according to the literature which came with it, if you read half and hour a day.  Since once I start a book I want to keep reading, that means I have to recharge it about twice a week.  Charge lasts for about one and a half books, 400 pages or so each.

I wasn't crazy about how the books appeared on my tablet but hesitated to go with a Kindle because I wasn't sure I would like it. I had kind of come to the conclusion that e-books were just not my thing.  I was wrong. The Kindle is such a great reader!

With the glare-free display I've had no trouble (thus far) reading in sunlight. Pages ""turn"" with a simple finger swipe. The special offers in no way interfere with the reading experience but are also not terribly relevant to me (at some point I will probably pay the extra $20 to have them removed).Honestly, if I'd known I would like it this much I probably would have went ahead and got the more expensive Paperwhite but I am very pleased with what I got.

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","R. Bodenstedt","Over the past few months I've had occasion to read several hard cover books, a basic Kindle, and a Kindle Paperwhite; so I thought a a comparison might be helpful.  To put this in perspective, I've been an avid reader for the past 57 years (yeah, I know; it blows my mind, too). I used to love nothing more than to browse a book shop.So, to the comparison; in my opinion the Paperwhite is hands down the best.  The back-lit screen makes reading a pleasure, even in brightly lit environments.  Far from causing eye strain, it actually makes reading easier on your eyes; there's no glare or uneven shading at all.  The basic Kindle is just OK. It's a bit lighter in weight and slightly smaller, not enough in either dimension to matter. But, the screen is dark, sepia toned in fact.  It's perfectly readable, but the back-lit screen of the Paperwhite is much better; even the pages of a hardcover book are lighter in tone than the basic Kindle.  Finally, reading a book is fine, but times change and I have to say that either Kindle is better, in my opinion.  A large part of this opinion is the large library of books that are easily available in the Kindle shop.  Sadly, the time of bookshops is largely past.  The selection in the Kindle shop is just so much larger than any physical shop could carry that browsing brick and mortar shops seems more like a waste of time than a pleasure, these days.  Also, carrying around a book is just a hassle.  It's much easier to sync my Android Kindle app with my Kindle and not have any extra baggage to carry. I feel that a Kindle is greener than physical books, as well.  It doesn't use any paper and there's no waste to dispose of.  It used to be you could give old books to a used book shop, but that's pretty rare, these days.My ranking, from most liked to least favorite (all are at least OK, though): Kindle Paperwhite, Basic Kindle, physical book.",3

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","danyitoo","Books are one of my favorite things. I have hundreds of books. My strong interest in books and all they contained started when my aunt (who was a school teacher) started taking me to our tiny town library well before my first birthday and has continued ever since. I enjoy reading all kinds of books on a variety of subjects. I read everything from history, Christian mysteries/romances, to biographaries, to cultural topics, to anything that catches my interest. Because many of the books (particularly the series) become my 'friends,' I do not like to part with them and will read them over and over again throughout the months or years. Because of this, I have a very large number of books in my apartment...all nicely housed in bookcases in some sort of order that makes sense to me (if no one else!). My best friend recently commented that I would soon either need to stop purchasing books or I would need a larger apartment so that they could have their own room. She meant it as a joke, but I realized that it was the truth. I certainly did not wish to get rid of any of my books (although I did convince myself to do a big purge, which made a local receiving organization very happy). However I knew that it was time to bite the bullet and move from paper books to ebooks. I had been resisting because I could not imagine reading a book that I could not hold in my hands.I started slowly by adding Kindle to my computer and purchasing a few ebooks. I found it a bit strange, but not terribly offensive! lol  So after using Kindle on my computer for some time and then receiving gift cards for my birthday I took the plunge and purchased an ebook, a Kindle E-reader 6"".  Even when I first purchased my Kindle E-reader it took me a few days to even do more than look at it and set it up so that I could make sure it worked. But then I thought I should at least give it a fair shot, so I synced my Kindle eReader with my online Kindle, purchased some more ebooks and began to build a relationship with my new Kindle E-reader. It has been a month and a half now, and I am feeling very comfortable with my Kindle E-reader. No it is not the same as holding a book in my hand or being able to write handwritten notes in the margins, etc. But amazingly in many ways it is much better. I can still read my favorite books as often as I want. I can purchase and read new books easily and quickly. I still have the same wide choices I did before with Amazon. I can still make notes in the books I read. And there are many added advantages for me. The Kindle E-reader saves me room while allowing me to have as many books as I wish without wondering where I am going to put them all. The Kindle E-reader is super easy to use, particularly with the touchscreen feature. There is a dictionary right in the Kindle E-reader, so if I need information I do not have to go to my computer to find it or whatever. It is convenient to take with me, some of the books I like to read can be bulky and/or heavy. This does not matter on the Kindle E-reader. The Kindle E-reader easily received five stars from me. It has worked well and with out any glitches since I first purchased it. As I said it is easy to use and convenient to use. It is definitely a keeper for me, and I would recommend it to anyone who might be considering purchasing an e-reader. One other thing about the Kindle that means a lot to me is the Amazon service that backs it up. Before I purchased my Kindle I called and asked several questions about it, I further called after receiving it for help in syncing it with my computer Kindle. Each time I contacted Amazon I was treated with respect and kindness by a professional and knowledgeable pleasant customer service representative who answered all of my questions and helped me with the syncing, etc. Since I am a person who believes that a product is only as good as the service that stands behind it, Amazon's five star service meant a lot to me, and helped to confirm for me that I had made the right choice in purchasing my Kindle E-reader. I will confess that I still buy a paper book now and then just for old times sake, but basically I am truly enjoying my Kindle E-reader and use it regularly. It has helped me in many ways in my busy life!",5

I love that I can change the font style and size. I love that it gives me an estimate for how long it will take me to read a chapter.I'm so happy that I bought this. No regrets.",5

Besides, back lighting would just use up the batter faster. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy the Kindle. Downloading new content is very easy and fast. Everything I've downloaded so far has been available to read immediately. I've also noticed I even read faster! Not sure why reading from a Kindle would be faster than a book, but after reading 3 novels already, the faster reading speeds have been very noticeable. I definitely recommend this product.",5

My first one still works, but slow, the 2nd was  Kindle Fire that lasted 1.5 yrs and the battery died and can't be fixed (a $499.00 purchase-I was given a $50.00 credit for the purchase of a new Kindle thru Amazon-woo hoo!). I am disappointed in this last purchase because I have to be in a well lit room in order to read it, no back-light which I thought was standard on Kindles.So, in a nutshell, I'll just have to be happy with this one -as long as it lasts.....",3

It has no back light so you cannot use it in the dark, but I was aware of that before buying. Books are quickly and easily downloaded and it's simple to search for a book you want. I'm also looking forward to using my local library's online borrowing system which will be so convenient as it does not require a trip to the library! Setup was easy, once you turn it on, it pretty much takes you through the setup step by step so I had not problem there. Very happy with my purchase.",5

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Scott Stathis","A decent device with a few flaws (slow responding to touch commands and a bit less resolution than I expected). However, my biggest complaint is that one of my primary reasons for purchasing this was to read the Wall St. Journal on it, especially when I travel. I currently pay for a print and digital WSJ subscription but was told that in order to get the WSJ on this reader I would have to pay an additional $29/mth - $348/yr (which is more than the current rate directly from the WSJ for a print and digital subscription). Clearly this is a ridiculous policy and should be changed. Is Amazon a liberal company that doesn't want its clients reading more conservative media? Amazon, please prove me wrong by fixing this issue.",3

"Kindle E-reader - Black, 6"" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi -  Includes Special Offers","Scientific Tester","Although this Kindle was much faster than my 1st generation model, it's software was underwhelming and downright non-intuitive. The on/off button is easy to hit while using the device, and forces a shutdown whether you hit the cancel box that sometimes appears (many times it does not). This can be a pain, since the screen which appears when you turn it back on and reboot is not always the place you left before it unceremoniously shut down. The bookmarks/notes/shares software needs serious work - it's obvious whoever wrote this software doesn't actually READ books and doesn't understand the concept of a bookmark, a note or a share. Including the functionality of Kindle for PC or Kindle for iPhone apps would be a place to start for those who've designed and coded this candidate for the bit-bucket - I wouldn't even use it in demos it falls so short of expectations.",2
